"""
The Play feature graphic, 1024 x 500, cut from real screenshots.

Not a mockup. The two panels are `store/shots/*.png`, taken off a device with
`adb exec-out screencap`, cropped below the status bar — and, on a debug build,
below the dev-launcher bubble, which must never reach a store listing. Nothing
here redraws the app: a feature graphic that promises a screen the app does not
have is the one thing a screenshot cannot accidentally do.

The type is the app's own. Spectral for the promise, which is the one thing
Welcome is allowed to set in the caption serif, and Be Vietnam Pro for
everything that is chrome. The words follow ASO.md's short description, so
the graphic and the listing cannot drift apart.

Play wants 1024 x 500, PNG or JPEG, no alpha, under 15 MB. The output is RGB
for that reason. Play also crops and masks this image differently across its
surfaces, so nothing that has to be read sits within 48 px of an edge.
