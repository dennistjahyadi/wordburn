"""
The Play phone screenshots, 1080 x 1920, composed from real device captures.

Play's Store Listing and Promotion policy wants screenshots that show the app,
so nothing here draws a screen: the pixels inside the frame come from
`store/shots/listing/*.png`, taken with `adb exec-out screencap`. This script
only puts a headline above them and a plate behind them, which is the part Play
shows in the carousel and the part people actually read.

The video inside those captures is `test-clips/demo/demo-1080x1920.mp4`, which
this repo generates for itself — see `scripts/make-demo-clip.py` for why no
stock clip can go here.

Two things the captures had to survive, both handled on the device rather than
here: the dev-launcher bubble sits exactly over Export and is turned off in the
dev menu under Tools button, and the status bar is put into SystemUI demo mode
so it reads 9:30 with a full battery instead of a developer's afternoon.
