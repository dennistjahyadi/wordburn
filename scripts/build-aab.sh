x No upload key. Play refuses a bundle signed with the debug keystore, which is
  the same key on every React Native machine in the world.

  Make one. It never expires in any way that matters — 10000 days is the
  convention, and Play App Signing means this key only ever signs uploads:

    keytool -genkeypair -v \\
      -keystore ~/keys/wordburn-upload.jks \\
      -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

  Then name it in $GRADLE_PROPERTIES, which is outside this
  repository and outside the generated android/ directory, both of which get
  thrown away and written again:

    WORDBURN_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=$HOME/keys/wordburn-upload.jks
    WORDBURN_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=the store password
    WORDBURN_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=upload
    WORDBURN_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=the key password

  Back that .jks up somewhere that is not this Mac. Enrol in Play App Signing
  at the first upload and losing it costs a support request rather than the app.

That fingerprint is what Play Console shows under Setup, App signing, as the
upload key certificate. If they ever disagree, the bundle was signed by
something else.

Upload it at Play Console, Release, Testing, Internal testing. The bundle is
larger than what anyone downloads: Play repacks it per device and sends one
architecture, so the install is roughly half of this.

Once this one has gone up, versionCode $VERSION_CODE is spent — Play will not take it
again. The next bundle needs:

  npm run bump
