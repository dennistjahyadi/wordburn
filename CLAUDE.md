# Wordburn — working notes

Offline, on-device auto-captions for short vertical video. No account, no upload,
no server. README.md carries the Stage 0 spike; this file carries the product.

## Stack

Expo dev client, New Architecture. whisper.rn 0.7.4 (patched, see `patches/`)
with Silero VAD. Native Expo Modules for audio extraction and burn-in.
react-native-skia 2.6 for the overlay, expo-iap 5.6 for the one-time unlock.
Fonts: Be Vietnam Pro and Spectral, both OFL, in `assets/fonts/`.

**Builds are local Gradle, not EAS.** This file used to name EAS Build; nothing
was ever set up there and there is no `eas.json`. `run.sh` builds APKs onto a
device and `scripts/build-aab.sh` builds the bundle for Play. Cloud builds would
have to be taught to fetch the 82 MB of models, which are not in git, so the
local build stays until there is a reason to move.

**Release builds go through R8**, which no bundle before this one did.
`enableMinifyInReleaseBuilds` and
`enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds` sit in `app.json` beside the rest of the
Android build properties, and `plugins/with-r8-optimization.js` swaps AGP's
default rule file for the one that does not say `-dontoptimize`. See the note in
"Things Android taught us the hard way" for what Play was complaining about and
what the numbers came out as.

**The models are in the APK.** `base.en-q8_0` is 81.8 MB and the Silero VAD is
0.9 MB, on top of a 62.9 MB app: an install of about 145 MB, inside the 150 MB
line. They live in `assets/models/`, which is not in git — `scripts/fetch-models.sh`
puts them there by exact byte count and `run.sh` calls it before every build.
`plugins/with-bundled-models.js` points the app's asset directory at them and
turns compression off for `.bin`, the same trick the burn-in module uses for
`assets/fonts`. whisper.rn opens them through Android's AssetManager, so nothing
is unpacked and there is no second copy of 82 MB on the phone.

expo-iap rather than the react-native-iap this file used to name: that library's
current release sits on react-native-nitro-modules, a second native module system
next to the Expo Modules this app is already built from. expo-iap is the same
author's Expo-Modules build of it, has no runtime dependencies, and pins the
exact expo, react and react-native versions in use here.

Skia 2.x requires react-native-reanimated, which in turn requires
react-native-worklets. Both are installed for that reason alone; nothing in the
app animates through them, because the caption animation is computed inside
`layoutCaptionFrame` where the export can run it too. `babel-preset-expo` adds
the worklets plugin on its own once the package is present, so there is still no
`babel.config.js`.

## Scope

**Five languages since slice 16: English, Spanish, German, Dutch and
Indonesian.** English stays on the bundled `base.en-q8_0`, which the Stage 0
spike chose for English on both speed and accuracy and which nothing here has
reason to disturb. The other four share one downloaded model,
`large-v3-turbo-q8_0` (874 MB), chosen in
`reports/Multilingual Whisper model for Android.md` as the only file a phone can
plausibly run under about 6.5% word error on read speech in all four. The
language is always the user's choice, made before the video is picked and
passed on every call — never auto-detected. Non-English words inside an English
sentence are still the dictionary's job. See README for the English evidence.

Out of scope: languages beyond those five, language detection, translation,
cloud anything, accounts, trimming inside the editor (auto clip trims its own
ranges; see slice 18), multiple speakers, emoji or B-roll or auto-zoom, iOS
background continuation, SRT import, and text behind the speaker (the draw list
reserves `layer` for it; build no segmentation now).

**The preset cap is lifted.** This file used to put "a fifth style preset" out
of scope. There are eighteen now, and the reason is in `references/`: five clips of
what the apps this one competes with actually ship. The look is the product for
a captions app, and the four v1 presets were a subtitle renderer's four looks
rather than a short-form video app's. See below for what changed and why it is
properties rather than presets.

## Invariants — write tests for these, do not trade them away

1. **Editing a word's text never changes its timing.** Timing moves only through
   nudge, shift, split and merge.
2. **Preview equals export.** One `layoutCaptionFrame` produces the draw list;
   the Skia preview and the burn-in both consume it. No second layout anywhere.
3. **No lost work.** A project file is written the moment a video is picked and
   every finished ASR segment is checkpointed.
4. **Audio plays while editing**, on every editing surface.
5. **No surprises at export.** The free-tier limit is on Home before the picker.
6. **Low confidence lives in the transcript only.** Never on the preview, never
   in the export. `layout.ts` does not import `confidence.ts`.
7. **All timing is integer milliseconds.** Convert at the edges only.

## Slice order — stop after each for review

1. Domain module and tests. **Done.**
2. Home and Processing: whisper.rn, checkpointing, an Android foreground service
   of type `mediaProcessing`, falling back to `dataSync` below Android 15.
   **Done. Both acceptance tests pass on the A54.** The service runs there as
   `types=00000001`, the `dataSync` branch. `mediaProcessing` is unverified: the
   only Android 15+ hardware to hand was an emulator, which starts the service
   and then stops it with "does not have any types" for reasons unknown.
3. Editor read-only: Skia overlay from `layoutCaptionFrame`, tap to seek.
   **Done. Verified on an Android 16 emulator, and driven on the A54 in slice 10.**
   The overlay held 61 fps in a release build there and produced no redraws at
   all while paused. The canvas following the video's own rectangle was checked
   on a 568×320 clip; a rotated phone recording, where the track dimensions and
   the upright ones disagree, is still unproven.
4. Word sheet, edit, undo and redo, low-confidence chip.
   **Done. Verified on an Android 16 emulator, and driven on the A54 in slice 10.**
   Checked on a real 173-word transcript: the chip walks the flagged words, an
   edit clears the flag and the count, "Fix 1 more like this" corrected both
   mishearings as one step, undo put both back, an override moved the big word
   inside its own line and nowhere else, and every change survived leaving the
   editor and coming back.
5. Timing sheet and shift-all.
   **Done. Verified on an Android 16 emulator, and driven on the A54 in slice 10.**
   On a real 173-word transcript: the steppers, both handles and a whole-word
   drag all moved the word and no other, Apply survived leaving the editor and
   coming back, Cancel and undo both put it back, and shift-all held at −150 ms
   because the first word starts there. The first build of the sheet could not
   move anything at all, which is the deviation below.
6. Style sheet with the four presets.
   **Done. Verified on an Android 16 emulator, and driven on the A54 in slice 10.**
   All four tiles animate the same line through the one layout, a picked colour
   lands on whatever each preset paints and follows a preset switch, size,
   position and words per line apply live, and the look survived leaving the
   editor and coming back. Undo of a word edit left the style alone.
7. Export, with a preview-versus-export frame comparison.
   **Done, and this one ran on the A54.** A 0:40 clip at 576×1024 burned in and
   landed in the gallery in 7 seconds, audio copied across untouched, 30 fps in
   and 30 fps out by `ffprobe`, 1217 frames for 40.57 seconds. The .srt came out
   valid subrip, 37 cues. The free counter fell 2 → 1 → 0 only on a successful
   save, and at 0 the button reads "Unlock to export" before anything renders.
   Slice 9 measured what this one could not: two 1080 × 1920 exports of a 0:22
   clip at 7 seconds each. Sixty seconds at 1080p is still unmeasured. The free
   tier no longer has to be spent to find out — the debug-APK dance in the build
   notes resets `entitlement.json` without touching projects or models.
8. Dictionary.
   **Done, verified on an Android 16 emulator.** Slice 9 put its list screen, its
   cap dialog and its footer count on the A54; the word-sheet route into it and
   applying an entry to a transcript are still emulator-only.
   One tap from a word sheet opens the dictionary with the entry half written,
   saving returns to the editor, and the chip there offers to apply it to the
   transcript already on screen as one undo step. A new transcription reads the
   dictionary at the start of the run and feeds the spellings to whisper as an
   initial prompt.
9. First launch, Unlock, IAP and the free-export counter.
   **Done, and this one ran on the A54.** The free tier is **3 exports**, full
   quality, no watermark. The models moved into the APK, which deleted the Model
   setup screen. `minSdkVersion` is 29.
   On the phone: Welcome drew its serif headline and its Restore said "No
   purchase found for this account" against a Play Billing connection that had
   genuinely answered (`Finsky: Billing preferred account via installer for
   com.captionfy.app` in logcat). A 0:22 clip picked from the gallery transcribed
   to 46 correct words with the model read straight out of the APK and
   `files/models` deleted from app storage. The counter fell 2 → 1 → 0 on
   successful saves only, and at 0 the button read "Unlock to export" before
   anything rendered. With `entitlement.json` seeded unlocked, Home showed no
   chip, Settings read "Unlocked · Sep 13, 2026", Export offered "Save to
   gallery" at three exports used, and Unlock showed the Unlocked screen. Reset
   to a fresh entitlement, Home read "3 free exports left". The dictionary at
   20 words offered its cap dialog and its Unlock button opened the screen.
   Also measured, which slice 7 could not: two 1080 × 1920 exports of a 0:22
   clip, 7 seconds each.
   **The purchase itself has never happened** — see Known issues.

10. Polish pass.
    **Done, on the A54.** Cold start, measured by recording the screen at 60 fps
    and reading the frames: Android reports `Displayed +186–196 ms` across three
    runs, and Home is fully drawn — chip, list and all — **0.30 s** after the
    launcher starts handing over.
    The overlay's own counter, release build, 127 word transcript: **0 fps
    paused**, **75–81 fps playing**. Against `dumpsys gfxinfo` over six seconds
    of playback: 678 frames, 5.8% janky, 50th 6 ms, 90th 9 ms, 99th 13 ms. With
    the style sheet open and its four live tiles: 633 frames, 36.7% janky, 50th
    9 ms, 90th 20 ms, 99th 36 ms. That is the cost CLAUDE.md predicted was worth
    reading, and it is real but not a broken screen — see below for where it
    goes and why nothing was changed.
    At **130% system font scale**: Home, the editor, Export, Unlock, Settings and
    all three sheets hold. The word sheet grows a row and still fits, the timing
    sheet keeps its waveform and all six steppers, the style sheet scrolls to
    Words per line. Nothing clipped, nothing unreachable, no overlapping lines —
    explicit `lineHeight` values smaller than the scaled `fontSize` turned out to
    be fine, because Android grows the line box rather than clipping.
    Reduced motion is now honoured by the chrome as well as the captions.
    Share reached **Instagram's Reels composer** and stopped at its account
    picker. Empty Home reviewed by hiding `files/projects`.
    Two 576 × 1024 exports of a 0:41 clip: 8 s each, 11.5 MB.
    One suspected defect turned out not to be one — see below.

11. Caption styles taken from the competition.
    **Done, and this one ran on the A54.** Four reference clips in `references/`
    — Captions, invideo, a Veed-style edit and a Submagic-style one — taken
    apart for what they do rather than what they look like, and the four
    mechanisms they share added to `StyleProps`: a line that reveals a word at a
    time, a per-word entrance, a shadow or glow instead of a stroke, and a card
    behind the block. Five presets arranged out of them — Spotlight, Word stack,
    Headline, Newsprint and Neon — and the picker's nine tiles moved into one
    Skia canvas.
    Designed in a headless harness first: the real `layoutCaptionFrame` over the
    real font metrics, drawn as SVG on a still and screenshotted. That is how
    the plate was caught breathing under the highlight, how the preset numbers
    were chosen, and how a white swatch on a white card was found.
    On the phone, release build, a real 145-word transcript: all nine tiles draw
    and animate, the glow renders, Spotlight's band puts its big word across the
    top with the sentence in the lower third, and a 0:41 clip exported at
    576 × 1024 in **8 seconds**. Two exports were checked frame by frame against
    what the preview drew. Spotlight's: the line builds word by word, the shadow
    is there, the banded word is where the preview put it. Neon's, which is the
    hardest case because it does three new things at once: the fill is caught
    mid-word — `YOU IMPR|OVE`, gold running into white — with the glow on every
    word and the line building `THAT` → `THAT CAN` → `THAT CAN HELP`. The Kotlin
    painter and the Skia overlay agree, `BlurMaskFilter` converted radius and
    all.
    Two free exports were spent proving this, so the counter on that phone is at
    one. Deleting `entitlement.json` from the debug build resets it.
    Frame timings are in the style-sheet section: **4.9% janky** playing with
    shadows on every word, **23.6%** with all nine tiles live, against the 37%
    slice 10 measured for four tiles in four canvases.

12. The free tier becomes a mark instead of a counter.
    **Built and run end to end, but on an emulator, not the A54.** `FREE_TIER` is
    `{ kind: 'watermark' }`: unlimited exports carrying a small wordmark that the
    unlock removes. The type and the `freeTierStatus` branch were already there
    and had been dead since slice 9; what was missing was anything that drew it.
    `layoutWatermark` is that, and it is a sibling of `layoutCaptionFrame` rather
    than part of it — see below for why.
    Verified on an Android 16 emulator, **release build**, on the 0:19 demo clip:
    Home reads "Free exports carry a small watermark" with no counter, Export
    reads "1080 × 1920 · 30 fps · with a watermark" and offers Save to gallery
    rather than a wall, and a 1080 × 1920 export rendered with the mark burned
    in. Measured on the exported frame against the preview, as fractions of the
    video's own rectangle: left 0.0611 against 0.0614, top 0.1375 against 0.1372,
    bottom 0.1490 against 0.1481, right 0.3000 against 0.3069. The one edge that
    moves is the right, by 7 px in a 1080 frame, which is the hinted advance
    rounding the Export section already documents for captions — it accumulates
    over the line, so it is larger for this wordmark than for the bare one it
    replaced and still under one percent.
    The mark sits inside `safeZoneUnion()` on all four sides and clears
    `CAPTION_INSET.upperMiddle`, both asserted in `watermark.test.ts` rather than
    left to the eye.
    **Those fractions predate a nudge.** Reviewed on 2026-09-18 against the
    editor's own safe-zone overlay, the mark was visibly reaching for the corner
    and missing it, so `TOP` went 0.135 → 0.125 and `LEFT` 0.06 → 0.05. The
    numbers above were measured before that and are the old position; what they
    still say, and the only thing they were there to say, is that the preview and
    the export agree to within the hinted-advance rounding. The corner clearance
    is now asserted in `watermark.test.ts` too, so it cannot drift back out into
    the middle of the band.
    **And they predate a redesign, twice over.** On 2026-09-19 the mark became a
    badge — the icon's three pills and "Captions by" over **Wordburn**, instead
    of one long line of type — and then the icon went from beside the words to
    above them, on the same day and for the same reason the stack happened at
    all: three tiers on one left edge read as one object, where a row of logo and
    type reads as two. `TOP` came down with it, 0.125 → 0.118, because a stack is
    taller than a row and the inset that read as pinned under two lines read as
    hanging under three. 0.110 is the floor: the safe zone is where the platforms
    start drawing.
    Both were designed in the same headless harness, over a real exported frame
    and a real near-white one, at 1:1, and then **run and measured on an Android
    16 emulator in a release build** — the first time any of it had been drawn by
    Skia or by the painter. The badge is 0.137 of the width against the 0.221 the
    row took and the 0.247 the single line took, its foot lands at 0.166 against
    `upperMiddle`'s 0.280, and its top at 0.118 is 0.008 under the safe line.
    Preview against export on the exported file, as fractions of each canvas:
    left 0.0500 against 0.0508, top 0.1182 against 0.1187, bottom 0.1661 against
    0.1659 — every one inside a single export pixel. The right edge is the one
    that moves, 0.1870 against 0.1738, and it is the hinted-advance rounding the
    Export section documents: see Known issues, because it is now bigger than
    that section claims.
    **Not run on the A54**, so by the line below this slice is not done.

13. Position becomes a number, colour becomes a pair, and a tenth preset is the
    one new users land in.
    **Written and tested, run on nothing.** Typecheck and 490 unit tests pass and
    the draw lists were drawn headless over real stills — see below — but no part
    of it has been on a device or an emulator.
    Three changes, one ask each. `CaptionPosition` is a fraction of the canvas
    height rather than one of four names, because "Lower" was a single number and
    the complaint it earned was that a lower third clearing TikTok's tray on one
    clip sits on somebody's chin in the next. `StyleChoices` carries a
    `textColor` beside its `color`, because a caption whose whole design is two
    colours cannot be described by one control. And **Read along** — the whole
    line waiting in a dim colour, each word turning solid as it is said — is the
    tenth preset, first in the grid, and `DEFAULT_STYLE_ID`.
    The preset cost one property. `highlightMode: 'snap'` is karaoke without the
    sweep, and it is a mode rather than a branch because the only thing it
    changes is when the colour arrives. Nothing native changed: the burn-in
    already draws whatever colour the draw list names.
    Checked in the headless harness the style slices used — advance widths out
    of the TTFs with fontTools, the real `layoutCaptionFrame` at 1080 × 1920, the
    draw list painted with PIL over two real stills. Over footage the two
    colours read at a glance and the shadow holds the type off the frame; over
    the near-white frame of the reference clip itself the shadow saves the
    legibility and the spoken/unspoken distinction nearly disappears, which is
    the case the new Text control exists for. Position was drawn at 0.2, 0.75
    and 0.9 and lands where it says.

14. Eight looks off the category leader, and a default chosen on evidence.
    **Written and tested, run on nothing.** Typecheck and 502 unit tests pass;
    no part of it has been on a device or an emulator.
    `references/deep-research-report.md` took Captions' published style catalogue apart the
    way slice 11 took the reference clips apart — by naming the behaviour each
    look relies on rather than by copying the picture — and the eight best
    documented of them are now presets: **Focus, Bold yellow, Core, Clarity,
    Negative, Sonnet, Neon glow and Rocket**. Eighteen in all.
    Seven of the eight needed no new code. The eighth did, and it is the one the
    file predicted: `highlightMode: 'active'`, a mark that travels with the voice
    and leaves nothing behind it, where `snap` says how far the speaker has got.
    It is eight lines in `colorOf` and nothing anywhere else — the burn-in draws
    whatever colour the draw list names, exactly as `snap` cost nothing.
    **`DEFAULT_STYLE_ID` is `focus`**, and the reason is not that it is the most
    used. The report is explicit that popularity and default suitability are
    different questions and that the currently trending look is a deliberately
    niche editorial serif. A default is an error-tolerant baseline: unknown
    footage, unknown niche, a phone at arm's length, a viewer with motion turned
    off. Focus is Read along's mechanism — the whole line present, one word
    marked — with the two things that survive all four: a card the app puts
    there rather than a frame it hopes is dark, and a mark that is a shape before
    it is a colour. Every number in it was measured rather than picked: white on
    `#2F5FEA` is 5.32:1, where the blue in the reference shot is 4.30:1 and
    misses WCAG's 4.5:1.
    Nothing was migrated. `readalong` is still a preset and every project and
    `settings.json` that names it still resolves.
    **Not run on any device**, so by the line below this slice is not done.

15. Wordburn Pro: a subscription instead of a one-time unlock, and a listing
    that sells volume instead of "offline".
    **Written and tested; the paywall drawn on an Android 16 emulator in a debug
    build, with sample plans. No purchase has run anywhere.**
    The product is repositioned around people who make a lot of clips — the
    build prompt's clippers — and every phase after this one is a feature for
    them. This slice is the money and the words: `wordburn_pro` with weekly,
    monthly and yearly base plans read from Play at runtime, a trial that is a
    Play Console offer, `pro.ts` deciding who is Pro across every state a client
    can see, and the legacy unlock kept as Pro for life. The Unlock route became
    the Pro screen and kept its name, so every door into it still works. The
    free tier did not move: single clips caption and export with the mark.
    Every "offline", "no upload", "pay once", "forever" and "no subscription"
    left the app, the listing and the release notes; the on-device fact is
    said once, in Settings. The privacy policy was rewritten for the
    subscription, the event log and the model download, and a terms page
    (`docs/terms.html`) exists because a subscription needs one.
    **Not run on the A54, and nothing bought**, so by the line below this slice
    is not done.

16. Spanish, German, Dutch and Indonesian.
    **Run end to end on an Android 16 emulator (6 GB, debug build); not on the
    A54.** The language is picked on Home before the video, remembered, and
    passed to whisper on every call. English stays on the bundled `base.en`; the
    other four share `large-v3-turbo-q8_0`, downloaded once from Hugging Face on
    request, behind Pro, a size check against the file's exact byte count, and a
    memory check. On the emulator, four text-to-speech clips of 20–24 s each,
    one per language: word error 6.3% es, 1.9% de, 0% nl, 4.8% id, and every
    miss a number written as digits ("ciento veinte" → "120"). 70–95 s per clip
    including the model load — an M3 host running an arm64 image, which says
    nothing about the A54.
    Four things this slice found by running it rather than by reading it:
    **whisper.rn never built the dot-product kernels** that q8_0 is fastest
    with, so the patch adds a `rnwhisper_v8fp16_dotprod` library and loads it
    when `/proc/cpuinfo` says `asimddp` (logcat on the emulator:
    `Loaded native library: rnwhisper_v8fp16_dotprod`).
    **A byte-level token can end inside a UTF-8 character**, and whisper.rn
    turned each token into a JS string on its own, so a split "é" would have
    arrived as two U+FFFD; the patch carries the unfinished bytes to the next
    token. **A German compound is wider than the frame at the preset's size**,
    fits the row count, and ran off both edges; the layout now also shrinks for
    width. **On a 2 GB emulator the model load killed every app on the
    device**, Wordburn included — the model is read whole into RAM — so the
    download is not offered below 5.5 GB of physical memory.
    Emphasis learned the languages too: per-language stopwords, and German's
    capital letters no longer read as names.

17. Batch captions: up to 30 clips, one language, one look, one queue.
    **Run end to end on an Android 16 emulator (6 GB, debug build); not on the
    A54.** `src/batch/queue.ts` works through `batch.json` one clip after
    another — transcribe, render, publish — holding the foreground service for
    the whole batch so the stop between two clips cannot let the process go.
    It pauses for storage (under 500 MB free) and waits out heat
    (`PowerManager` thermal status severe) and says which on the Queue screen;
    a batch interrupted by the app dying picks up where it stopped on the next
    launch. `QueueHost` in the root layout is what hands the queue the caption
    measurer, so the queue runs whatever screen is up. Looks can be saved by
    name from Settings → Default style and picked for a batch.
    On the emulator: two English clips through the real picker, Karaoke fill,
    94 s, both in `Pictures/Wordburn/` with the fill caught mid-word on the
    exported frame; and `scripts/test-batch.sh`, the instrumented test, two
    copies of a 30 s clip in 173 s.
    **Android's photo picker does not give a file's name** — it gives the
    media id, `39.mp4` — so a batch named `<original>_captioned` came out
    `39_captioned`. `pickedClipName` keeps a real name and replaces an id with
    the day and the clip's place in the batch.

18. Auto clip: suggested shorts from a long video.
    **Run end to end on an Android 16 emulator; not on the A54.** A long video
    (5 minutes or more; the first hour in English, the first half hour in the
    downloaded languages) is transcribed as an ordinary project with
    `purpose: 'autoclip'`, and opens on its suggestions instead of the editor.
    `autoclip.ts` cuts the transcript at sentence ends and long pauses, joins
    whole units into 20–60 s windows, scores them with `ClipScorer` — hook
    phrase or question in the first three seconds, speech density, repeated
    keywords, a clean ending, and a penalty for intro and outro — and takes the
    ten best that do not overlap. The top five are preselected. Each can be
    played (the preview loops the range), moved on a timeline or a word at a
    time, stripped of dead air, removed, or joined by one the user sets.
    A chosen clip is a batch job of kind `cut`: the burn-in module now takes
    `segments` in the plan and renders only those stretches of the source,
    laid end to end, audio copied rather than re-encoded; that cut becomes the
    source video of a new, ordinary project whose words and envelope are the
    long video's moved onto the cut's timeline; and that project is rendered
    like any other. Two passes through the encoder, at the same settings.
    On the emulator, a 7:09 English test episode written with four planted
    moments: transcribed in 385 s, the four moments came back as the top four
    (89, 86, 67, 55), the intro and outro did not. A 48 s suggestion with Remove
    dead air came out 38.26 s, the longest silence left in it 340 ms, audio and
    video within 21 ms of each other.
    **Dead air could not be found from the word timings at all.** whisper's
    timestamps stretch a sentence's last word across the pause after it
    ("scratch." 9.9–10.7 s where the voice stopped at 10.1 s), so there is no
    gap between words to cut. `quietStretches` reads the silence off the
    envelope instead, and a word whose start drifted into a cut moves to where
    the sound resumes rather than being dropped. **Neighbouring words share a
    start time** (58 of 985 on the test episode), so the ‹ word › buttons step
    by time, not by index.

Every slice runs as a release build on the Galaxy A54 before it is called done.

## Known issues

Eight are left, and none of them can be closed from this machine.

- **Batch and auto clip have never run on a phone**, and the numbers above are
  an M3 emulator's. What the A54 has to answer: a batch of thirty — whether the
  queue survives thirty clips' worth of heat and the system's patience with a
  foreground service, and whether it resumes cleanly after the app is swiped
  away mid-clip; an hour of real podcast through auto clip — memory with 115 MB
  of PCM in the JS heap, the time it takes, and whether the scorer's picks are
  the ones a person would have picked, which text-to-speech with planted hooks
  cannot say. Real speech has room tone, breaths and music under it, and
  `quietDb` at −24 dB was chosen on silence that was truly silent.

- **The four downloaded languages have never run on a phone.** The emulator
  proved the path — download, language, model, words, accents — and says
  nothing about speed: the report's estimate for turbo on the A54 is 40–55 s
  per minute of audio with the dotprod kernels and 150–180 s without, against
  a 45 s budget, and the emulator ran on an M3. Time a real minute of each
  language on the A54, peak memory with the editor open, and the third clip of
  a batch in a row (heat). If turbo misses, `small-q8_0` (264 MB) carries
  Spanish and German and not the other two; see the report. Also unrun:
  anything but text-to-speech, which is kinder to a recogniser than a person.

- **R8 has never run on the A54.** The release build that Play will grade was
  driven end to end on an Android 16 emulator — Welcome, Home, the picker, a
  0:19 clip transcribed to the right words with the model read out of the APK,
  the Skia overlay and the watermark drawing, and a 1080 × 1920 export burned in
  and published to the gallery in 9 s — so whisper's JNI binding, the Expo
  modules, Play Billing's classes and the burn-in all survive obfuscation. What
  an emulator cannot answer is the thing R8 is most likely to have moved:
  **cold start and the frame rates**, both of which this file quotes to three
  significant figures off that phone and neither of which has been read since
  the DEX went from 51 MB to 11.9 MB. Nothing in the app is expected to be
  slower and some of it should be faster; expected is not measured. The purchase
  path is the one code path still unexercised under R8, and it is unexercised
  for the separate reason below.

- **Slice 14 has not been drawn by Skia or by the painter, anywhere.** Eight new
  presets, a new highlight mode and a new default, all of them unit tests and
  nothing else. What a phone has to answer, in order of how likely it is to
  bite:
  **The picker's grid.** Nine rows of tiles is about three screens of scrolling
  before the colour control, where ten presets was under two, and
  `SCROLL_SHARE`'s premise — the grid and the colour both in view from the start
  — is now false. Three columns, a horizontal band, or a grid that collapses to
  the chosen row are all plausible and all of them are decided by how a tile
  reads at a third of the width, which is a question for a device.
  **What eighteen live tiles cost.** Nine in one canvas measured 23.6% janky on
  the A54; eighteen is unmeasured, and four of the new ones carry a glow or a
  card on top.
  **The default's card.** A 78% near-black plate under every caption is the
  biggest visual change this app has made, and whether it reads as a considered
  background or as a subtitle bar is a thing to see on a panel, not in a test.
  **Nothing about the export is expected to move**: `active` puts a different
  colour in the draw list, and the plate and the pill are shapes both renderers
  already draw. Expected is not measured, and a preview-versus-export frame
  comparison on Focus and on Neon glow is what would settle it.
  Also unrun: whether Spectral at `Sonnet`'s long 380 ms arrival reads as
  deliberate or as lag, and whether Rocket's 100 ms slam is tolerable at 30 fps —
  three frames.

- **Slice 13 has not been drawn by Skia or by the painter, anywhere.** The
  position dial, the colour tabs and the Read along preset exist in unit tests
  and in a headless harness and nowhere else. What a phone has to answer: whether
  the dial's drag survives the `ScrollView` it sits in (it is switched off from
  the moment a finger lands in the dial, which is the fix, and the one thing no
  test here can prove), whether a continuous drag through `restyle` holds its
  frame rate on the sheet that was already the expensive screen, whether the two
  colours read as two controls at 130% font scale, and whether the dim white of
  Read along is the right dim on a real panel at arm's length. The export side is
  unexercised too, though it is the least likely to surprise: `snap` puts a
  different colour in the draw list and changes nothing about how one is drawn.

- **The watermark has never run on the A54.** Slice 12 was verified end to end on
  an Android 16 emulator in a release build — the mark is burned into a real
  exported file and measured against the preview — but the phone was not
  connected, so by this file's own rule the slice is not done. What is unproven
  there is what the emulator cannot answer: how the mark reads on a real panel at
  arm's length, and whether the extra draws per repaint cost the burn-in anything
  measurable. They should not: it is three boxes and four text draws on a bitmap
  that is already being repainted, and only when the entry changes.
  **The badge of 2026-09-19 has run on an emulator and nowhere else.** Both
  renderers drew it in a release build on an Android 16 emulator — the pills, the
  stack, the shorter top inset — and the four fractions were taken again off a
  real exported file against the preview. Three of the four agree inside one
  export pixel. The fourth is the right edge, and it has grown: **0.0132 of the
  width, 14 px in a 1080 frame, where the Export section below says the hinted
  advances round to under one percent.** It is stable across luminance thresholds
  and it is the documented mechanism rather than a new one — a 512-wide preview
  canvas rounds a 30 px face's advances further from a 1080-wide export's than
  the 668-wide canvas did — but the sentence claiming "under one percent" is
  wrong for this mark and wants rewriting once the A54 has had its turn.
  Also unrun on any device: the store screenshots in `store/play-screenshots/`
  predate all of this and three of the eight now contradict the app. See
  `PLAY-CONSOLE.md`.

Closed in slice 11: the five new presets, the shadow, the plate and the
one-canvas tile grid all ran on the A54, in a release build, and both renderers
were checked against each other on an exported file. The blur conversion is
right, the shadow costs the overlay nothing measurable, and nine tiles in one
canvas beat the four the old grid drew in four.

- **The feedback card has never been drawn on any device.** Typecheck and 477
  unit tests pass and the pure half — both URLs, the encoding round trip and the
  once-ever rule — is covered in `support.test.ts`, but nothing here has been run:
  not the card on Saved, not the Settings row, and neither `Linking` call. Three
  things only a phone can answer. Whether the mail app takes a prefilled subject
  and body at all, which is the whole design and is per-app behaviour. Whether
  `Platform.constants.Model` and `.Release` are populated in a release build.
  And whether the three wrapped actions still read as three actions at 130% font
  scale, which is the scale everything else in the app was checked at. Reaching
  TikTok's own DM screen is the same half-proof Instagram got in slice 10 — a
  machine should stop at somebody's real account — and TikTok proper is still not
  installed on the A54.
- **Nobody has ever subscribed.** Play Billing connects, and the product
  query answers — with nothing, because `wordburn_pro` does not exist in any Play
  Console yet. So `subscribe`, the purchase sheet, the trial, the pending state,
  the acknowledgement, account hold, and a real restore on a second device are
  all unrun code. The states are unit tested against the shapes Play Billing
  documents; the phone has to answer whether expo-iap reports them that way,
  above all `isSuspendedAndroid` and `currentPlanId`. `PLAY-CONSOLE.md` section
  9 has the subscription field by field and the licence-testing route, where
  Play runs a year in thirty minutes.
- **iOS has never been built.** Not once, in any slice. Nothing is known about
  the Skia overlay, the fonts, the player or the pause-on-background rule there,
  and there is no iOS burn-in at all.
- **TikTok has never received a share.** Slice 10 took a finished export into
  Instagram's Reels composer, as far as its account picker, which is where a
  machine should stop inside somebody's real account. TikTok proper is not
  installed on the A54 — only TikTok Shop Seller — so that half is unproven.

Closed in slice 10: slices 3 to 6 had never run on the A54, and now they have.
The editor, the word sheet, the timing sheet and the style sheet with its four
live tiles were all driven on the phone, and the overlay's frame rate was read
off a release build there (75–81 fps playing, 0 paused). `SHOW_OVERLAY_FPS` in
the editor is the switch; it goes back to false in what ships.

Closed in slice 9: the .srt could not be saved below Android 10, because
MediaStore's permissionless write arrived there and `minSdkVersion` was 26. The
floor is 29 now. The alternative was a legacy storage path that nobody here owns
a device to run, and this app is unusable on that hardware anyway — `base.en` on
a 2017 phone is not a product.

Closed after slice 4, all found while accepting slices 3 and 4: the box highlight
crowding its neighbours, a delete dialog that did not name what it was deleting,
"1 words" on Home, the fps readout shipping switched on, and a picker duration
that disagreed with the file by seven seconds.

The model decision is made and the number it was made on was wrong. This file
said bundling lands "near 120 MB"; the real weights are 81.8 MB and 0.9 MB
against a 62.9 MB app, so it lands at about 145 MB. Still inside the 150 MB line,
by five megabytes rather than thirty. Anything else that wants to ride in the APK
has to argue with that gap.

## Deviations from the UI spec, all accepted

- `layoutCaptionFrame` takes a text measurer: two measurers would be two layouts.
- `Word.confirmed` carries "Looks right", which must clear the low-confidence
  flag without overwriting the engine's probability.
- `mergeWords(words, ids)` takes a list and joins without a separator, since a
  merged word holding a space would be split apart by the next text edit.
  Keeping words together on a line is `setBreakAfter(id, 'none')`.
- Max rows is a style property. One line on screen is structural: `displayUnits`
  returns the units the viewer sees one at a time.
- Emphasis takes an `EmphasisContext`, because the envelope the features come
  from is not in the project, only its path.
- The word sheet shows the actions that exist. Timing joins it in slice 5 and
  Dictionary in slice 8, rather than sitting there disabled in the meantime.
- Delete is a plain action at the foot of the sheet, not inside an overflow. One
  item is not a menu, and undo is in the toolbar for every action equally.
- Sheet actions are labels without icons, because no icon set has been chosen and
  a hand-drawn one per action would be four inconsistent glyphs.
- **An edge a word shares with its neighbour is a boundary, and moving it moves
  both words.** The engine hands back one boundary between one word and the next,
  so on a real transcript every handle was already against a wall and the first
  build of the timing sheet could not move anything at all. A shared edge now
  carries the neighbour with it, as far as the neighbour's own `MIN_WORD_MS`. A
  handle at a gap still stops dead: the silence is not the neighbour's to give
  away. `nudgeWord` owns this; `setWordTiming` stays the unlinked primitive.
- Shift-all works in totals, not increments: the readout is where the captions
  are, so opening it a second time says what the first visit decided.
- Shift-all is a chip in the toolbar rather than the spec's overflow menu, for
  the same reason Delete is not in one. Rename and Delete join it in a later
  slice and an overflow can arrive with them.
- The style sheet's preview is the editor's own stage rather than a second copy
  inside the sheet. One video view, one overlay, one layout; the stage gives up
  height while that sheet is open so the captions are not behind it.
- **The editor's stage is 38% of the screen, not 46%, and there is no controls
  row.** Measured on the A54 the old layout gave the transcript 28% of the
  screen, five rows, under a stage that was 44% black pillar either side of a
  9:16 clip. Now the scrubber is a hairline on the stage's own bottom edge with
  the transport in the corner over it, the timecode and undo/redo are in the
  bar, and a transcript row is 36 points with a hit slop back to `MIN_TOUCH`.
  The transcript has about 45% and ten rows; the clip previews at 191 points
  wide rather than 231, which is the cost. Two other layouts were drawn at the
  phone's size and turned down on 2026-09-18: a stage that crops to the caption
  band (captions 1.8× bigger, but the whole frame is a drag away and the window
  has to follow the style's position) and a video-first transcript sheet (the
  short-form convention, but it covers the lower third, where the captions are,
  and every editing surface here is already a sheet). `store/shots/editor.png`
  predates this and wants retaking.
- **Picking a video drops a curtain.** The picker copies the file into this
  app's cache before it hands control back, seconds on a long clip, and Home
  sat there fully tappable under a spinner on one button. `Curtain` covers the
  screen from the tap until Processing is up, takes every touch and the back
  button, and animates the product's own box highlight along "Getting your
  video ready" on the native driver, so it keeps moving while the JS thread is
  moving the file. It is a view in the screen rather than a `Modal`, because a
  modal is a window above every screen and would have covered Processing too;
  Home lifts it when it is next focused, not when it blurs, so it is never seen
  uncovering itself under the transition. The editor's "Choose the video
  again" uses the same one. Processing is untouched: its Cancel and its playing
  video are deliberate.
- The style sheet stores **choices**, not properties: a colour, a size, a
  position, a words-per-line, each only when it differs from the preset it was
  set on. That is what lets a colour follow the user from preset to preset while
  Clean subtitle still looks like Clean subtitle. `styleChoices` reads them back
  out of a project and `styleOverridesFor` puts them onto a preset.
- One colour control, not one per preset property. The swatch paints the box in
  Box highlight, the fill and the spoken words in Karaoke, and the big word in
  the two presets that mark nothing as it is spoken — and the big word in all
  four, so switching preset keeps it. `accentColor` reports the same colour back,
  which is why the chrome turns with it.
- **Two colour controls now, and still not one per property.** The pair is
  "Highlight" and "Text": what this preset marks a word with, and what it draws
  the words it is not marking. One was enough for a design where the quiet
  colour is always white, and Read along is not that design — its whole content
  is two colours, and a control that could only set one of them would leave the
  other at whatever the preset was written in. `captionTextColor` and
  `textColorOverrides` are the second pair of `accentColor` and
  `highlightColorOverrides`, and they are trivial where those are not: an
  unmarked word is `textColor` in every preset there is. They are functions
  anyway, so the sheet writes both colours the same way.
  They are tabs over one row of swatches and one hue strip rather than two rows
  of each, because the row and the strip are the tall part and the sheet is
  already the tall screen. The swatches differ by tab: six accents for the
  highlight, and white, dimmed white, ink and three accents for the text, since
  the interesting question about a caption body is how far down it goes.
- **Position is a fraction of the frame, not one of four names.** `top`,
  `upperMiddle`, `middle` and `lowerThird` are `CAPTION_BAND` now — ordinary
  values with nothing special about them — and the style carries the number the
  captions' centre sits on. Four answers were never enough for a question that
  is different on every clip, which is the whole of the complaint: a lower third
  that clears the platform's tray on one video is across somebody's face on the
  next, and there was no way to say "a little lower than that". Projects written
  before this carry one of the four strings and `resolveStyle` reads them, which
  is cheaper than a migration over every file on the phone and is the one
  function every style already goes through.
  The centre rather than an edge, because that is what a finger dragging a block
  of text is holding, and because the old names anchored differently from one
  another — `top` by its top, `lowerThird` by its bottom — which is invisible
  until something has to interpolate between two of them. What it costs is that
  a line wrapping to a second row now grows in both directions instead of
  keeping its last row on a fixed line. The layout holds the block on the canvas
  and does nothing else: the safe zone stays a warning drawn over the preview,
  because a caption is allowed to sit outside it and some of them should.
- **The position control is a picture of the frame, not a slider.** A tall
  rectangle at the video's own proportions with the safe zone dashed inside it
  and a bar where the captions are; tap or drag to put the bar anywhere. A
  slider would have been fewer lines and would have asked the user to convert a
  percentage into a place. The three bands are still one tap each, beside it, and
  a drag that lands within 0.012 of one snaps to it — otherwise the chips could
  never light up again once anything had been dragged, and "put it back" would
  stop being something a thumb can do.
  It is a diagram and not a preview: a bar at a fraction of a rectangle, with no
  text, no measurer and no layout in it. The real preview is above the sheet
  while the dial is being dragged, and a second drawing of the captions would be
  a second thing for the export to disagree with (invariant 2).
  The obvious control — dragging the captions on the preview itself — cannot be
  built while the sheet is a `Modal`. A Modal is its own window: its backdrop
  takes every touch above the dock and nothing passes through to the screen
  underneath, whatever `pointerEvents` says. Moving the style picker out of the
  sheet to get it would be a redesign of an accepted screen.
- **Read along was the preset a new project starts in, and it is Focus now.**
  Before that it was Box highlight, which shouts, and somebody who opens this app
  to put subtitles on a clip has not asked for a style yet — they have asked to
  be understood. Read along answered that: the whole line on screen in a dim
  white, each word turning solid as it is said, the mechanism of
  `references/kitverify-offer-portrait.mp4`. Nothing moves and nothing arrives,
  so the eye can be a word ahead of the voice, which is the point of putting a
  sentence on a video somebody is watching at speed.
  Focus keeps all of that and fixes the one thing it was hoping for. Read
  along's legibility is a shadow's worth of separation from whatever is behind
  it, and the frame behind a first export is a frame nobody here has seen. Focus
  puts a near-black card at 78% under the line, so the background is a thing the
  app decides rather than a thing it inherits, and marks the word being said with
  a blue pill instead of a colour change — a shape survives a frame that a hue
  does not, and it is a second cue for anybody who cannot separate the two
  colours. The settle, three percent of a word's size over 160 ms, is a third.
  The card is the cost and it is a real one: it is the first thing this app has
  drawn that the video cannot be seen through, and a default that puts furniture
  on every frame has to be worth it. The argument that it is, is in
  `references/deep-research-report.md` and is about contrast being controlled rather than
  hoped for. It is also the one deviation in this file that nobody has looked at
  on a panel.
  **The chrome turns blue.** `accentColor` reports `#2F5FEA` for a box preset, so
  a fresh install is blue where Read along made it white and Box highlight made
  it yellow. That is better than white: the interface has no accent of its own
  and a default that gives it one is a default that shows what the colour control
  does.
  Read along is unchanged and one tile away, and nothing was migrated: every
  project and every `settings.json` naming it still resolves. Its dim is still a
  colour and not an opacity, because both colours are the user's to pick and
  dimming one on top would mean the swatch and the caption disagree — white at
  55% rather than a grey, so it stays a weaker version of whatever colour it
  becomes.
- **`highlightMode: 'active'` is the mode the archetype needed, and `snap` could
  not fake it.** `snap` colours every word the speaker has reached and leaves
  them coloured; `active` colours exactly one. The difference is what the mark
  means — how far the voice has got, against where the voice is — and the second
  is what the "one bold yellow word" look every short-form app ships is actually
  doing. Written as `snap` it would have been Read along in different paint.
  It is a mode rather than a preset flag for the reason the last one was: the
  only thing it changes is which word holds the colour, and it cost the export
  nothing, because the burn-in draws whatever colour the draw list names.
  The big word keeps the accent throughout rather than dropping back with the
  rest. Its size has already told the viewer it is different, and a word that
  lost its colour the instant it was said would read as the emphasis switching
  off.
- **Eight presets came from a competitor's catalogue and none of its pixels.**
  `references/` is footage this repository does not keep;
  `references/deep-research-report.md` is the same discipline applied to a published style
  catalogue — what each look does, not what it looks like — and the eight that
  survived it are eight rows of properties in `STYLE_PRESETS`. What did not
  survive is anything the app cannot already say: letter spacing, a condensed
  display face and a per-preset line height are all gaps with names, and Rocket
  is a poster face in the original and an extra-bold grotesk here.
  The report's own tokens were followed where they were measurable and darkened
  where they were not good enough: its Focus blue is 4.30:1 under white and
  misses WCAG's 4.5:1 for body text, so this app's is 5.32:1.
- **The primary button's label is chosen against the accent rather than assumed
  to be ink.** `ON_ACCENT` was a constant `#111111` and it was right every time,
  because every accent this app could produce was pale: the six swatches are all
  light and the hue strip is fixed at 56% lightness. The new default is not. Its
  blue was picked for 5.32:1 under white *on a video*, and dark ink on it is
  3.55:1 — a legible caption and an illegible button, from one number used for
  two jobs. `readableOn` takes the better of ink and paper by measured contrast,
  which also closes a hole that was already there: a custom colour dragged to
  the dark end of the strip could always have produced an unreadable button and
  simply never had.
  It does not close it completely. Ink and paper leave a gap between them, and
  eighteen of the strip's 360 hues — violets around 280° — land in it at 4.09:1
  rather than 4.5:1. That clears the 3:1 WCAG allows for the 19px semibold the
  label is set in, and closing it properly would mean painting the button in
  pure black and white instead of this app's own two. The test asserts 4.5 for
  every accent that ships and 4.0 for the whole strip, so the limit is written
  down rather than discovered again.
- **Eighteen tiles is past what the two-column grid was designed for.** Ten fit
  in under two screens of scrolling; eighteen is about three, and the colour
  control is behind all of it. The fix is a layout decision that depends on how a
  tile reads at a third of the width, which is a device question, so it is
  written down here and in `StylePicker` rather than guessed at.
- A colour picked in Clean subtitle does colour its big word. A preset that
  answered a swatch with no visible change would read as broken.
- Export and Saved are `/export/[id]` and `/saved/[id]`, following Processing
  rather than the spec's nested `/project/[id]/export`. One shape for every
  screen that is about one project.
- The video is saved through `expo-media-library`, as the build prompt's stack
  says, asked for **write-only** and for **video alone**. That combination comes
  to no permission at all on Android 13 and up, which is what the module's own
  MediaStore code was for: adding a file you own needs none. Asked the default
  way the library opens with "allow access to music and audio on this device"
  and then asks for every photo as well, which was measured on the A54 before it
  was narrowed. The subtitle file still goes through MediaStore in the module,
  because a subtitle is not media and no media library will take one.
- Permission is asked for before the render rather than after: a sheet at the end
  of a minute of encoding is an export that failed at the last step.
- The burn-in is Android only. iOS has never been built in any slice, and a Swift
  implementation nobody can run is a file that rots rather than a feature.
- The custom colour is a hue strip and not a full picker: a washed-out caption is
  an unreadable one, so saturation and lightness are fixed and the swatches carry
  white. Dragging on it changes the colour rather than scrolling the sheet, as
  any slider does.
- Box mode spaces every word by the box's own padding on top of a space, so the
  words sit a little wider apart than in the other presets. The box is padded
  past its own word and a space is narrower than that padding, so the choice was
  an airier line or a highlight sitting on the next word's first letter. The gap
  is uniform rather than only around the active word: a gap that moved with the
  highlight would shove the line sideways on every word.
- `project.durationMs` starts as the picker's claim and is replaced by the
  decoded audio's own length once the PCM exists, because the picker has been
  seen to be seven seconds out on a sixty second clip.
- **There is no Model setup screen.** Screen 2 of the spec existed to watch an
  83 MB download and to have somewhere to fail; the models are in the APK, so
  Welcome goes straight to Home and the whole screen, its progress bar, its
  offline copy, its checksum retry and Processing's "finishing model download"
  first stage are all gone rather than kept as dead code.
- `Settings.welcomeSeen` in place of the spec's `modelVerified`. Nothing is
  verified any more; the only question left is whether this person has been told
  what the app is.
- The free-tier line is one component on three screens, and the spec's two
  sentences for the spent state became one: `freeTierStatus` returns "Free
  exports used", the spec's own words for it on Export, and Home, Saved and
  Settings say the same. Two phrasings of one fact is the app disagreeing with
  itself between screens. That line is now "Free exports carry a small
  watermark" on all of them, and nothing says "used", because nothing is spent.
- **The free tier is a mark, not a counter, and the reason is that the counter
  walled off the wrong thing.** Three clean exports sounds generous until you ask
  what the trial is for. Checking that the captions match the audio does not need
  an export: the editor plays the real overlay through the real layout, free and
  forever, which is invariant 2 doing a second job nobody designed it for. What
  three rationed was finished files — and `runExport` charges again for every
  re-export, so a style tweak and a second save spent two of them. The mark trades
  a wall nobody could see coming for one they can. `exportsUsed` still counts and
  nothing reads it for gating; the free-tier test asserts that 99 exports still
  do not block, so a counter cannot grow back by accident.
- **Superseded in slice 15, kept for the reasoning:** the paywall now sells
  Wordburn Pro, a subscription, and lists five things — the watermark, batch,
  auto clip, the four downloaded languages and the dictionary cap — because
  those are what it gates. What survives from below is the rule: every line on
  that screen is something the payment actually changes, and the goodwill line
  stays under the button, never on it.
- **The Unlock screen sells the watermark, not "everything", and the button is
  never a tip jar.** Two copy decisions, one cause: when the counter became a
  mark, the paywall stopped standing in front of most of what the screen was
  promising. `PROMISES` still listed "All caption styles" and "Unlimited
  exports, full quality" — all eighteen presets, every export and the whole
  editor are free, so a tick beside them is a claim the user's own app
  contradicts, and on a billing screen that is a Play problem as well as a
  dishonest one. It is three lines now, each of them a thing the payment
  actually changes or guarantees: the watermark, the dictionary cap, and the
  shape of the deal. The headline leads with what the money does — "Export
  without the watermark." — and "Buy it once. Keep it forever." drops to the
  line under it, where a payment model belongs once the purchase has been
  named. The same edit went through `FreeTierLine`, whose "Unlock everything →"
  now follows `tier.watermark` the way its chip already follows `tier.line`,
  and through Settings, where the row read "Unlock everything" directly above
  "Free exports carry a small watermark".
  **"Support the developer" was considered for the button and turned down.** It
  reframes a purchase as a donation, and the two audiences barely overlap:
  somebody who would pay to get a clean file taps a button that sounds optional
  much less readily, and somebody who taps it out of goodwill has in fact bought
  a feature nobody told them about — a bait-and-switch in the one direction that
  matters. The button is the single place in this app that has to be literal
  about what money does. The goodwill line survives under it instead, where the
  trade is already settled: "Wordburn is built by one independent developer.
  Your support means more time to improve the app, fix the little things, and
  keep making it better. Thank you."
  Three beats, and the order is the argument: who is behind it, what the support
  actually pays for, and a thank you. The middle sentence promises **time**
  rather than features — the small fixes nobody writes a roadmap entry for —
  which is the honest answer for a one-person app and the one a reader can
  believe, where a list of promised features on a payment screen is a debt.
  **It is third person, where everything else in this app is first.** Dennis's
  own words, kept as written: it is his app and his voice, and the distance
  reads as modesty rather than as a company. The convention below still holds
  for the feedback card, which is the screen that cannot afford a "we" — "I read
  every message" is a promise no company voice can make. If the two should ever
  be reconciled, this is the line to move.
- **The watermark is not part of `layoutCaptionFrame`.** It is `layoutWatermark`,
  its own pure function of a canvas and a measurer, in its own file. A mark takes
  no part in fitting, shrinking, revealing or emphasis, and threading an
  entitlement flag into the caption layout would put billing inside the one
  module allowed to know nothing but words and time. What it keeps is the part
  that matters: preview and export call the same pure function over the same
  injected measurer at their own two sizes, which is exactly how the captions
  hold invariant 2, so the mark holds it for the same reason and not a new one.
- **The mark is drawn on the editor's preview as well as into the file.** A
  watermark that appeared only at export is precisely the surprise invariant 5
  forbids, and the whole point of a free tier you can evaluate is that what you
  are looking at is what you will get. It is on `CaptionOverlay` rather than
  inside `CaptionElements`, so the style sheet's ten tiles do not each grow one:
  a tile is a hundred points tall and is answering a question about the preset.
  Settings' default-style screen does not get one either — it exports nothing.
- **Top-left, and the corners were all wrong.** `safeZoneUnion()` leaves the
  bottom 0.22 and the right 0.24 of a vertical frame under TikTok's action rail
  and the caption tray, so a mark in either bottom corner is invisible where it
  is meant to be seen and in the way while the user reviews. The band from 0.110
  (the union's top) to 0.280 (`CAPTION_INSET.upperMiddle`, the highest caption
  the style sheet can make) is the only place that is both on screen everywhere
  and not already spoken for. `top` at 0.12 would clash, which is one more reason
  `StylePicker` does not offer it. Bottom-left fails twice over: it is where the
  captions are, because `lowerThird` sits directly on top of that same 0.22.
  The convention the other apps follow — CapCut, Veed and Canva are all
  bottom-right — was weighed and turned down for exactly this. Their mark is
  mostly a nag aimed at the person who made the video, and being half under
  TikTok's rail is a price they accept; a line that says "Captions by Wordburn"
  is aimed at the viewer, and a credit nobody can read is not a credit.
- **The mark is pinned to the safe zone, not placed in the frame.** `TOP` and
  `LEFT` are 0.118 and 0.05, which is 0.008 of the height under the union's top
  and 0.010 of the width inside its left — 15 px and 11 px on a 1080 × 1920
  frame. They were 0.135 and 0.06, and that is a sixth of the band down and half
  a point in from the margin: near enough the corner to be reaching for it and
  far enough to miss, so the mark read as a label dropped into the shot rather
  than a bug on it. Looked at on 2026-09-18 with the editor's own safe-zone
  overlay, which is the picture that made it obvious; `TOP` came down again on
  2026-09-19, from 0.125, when the icon moved over the words and made the block
  a tier taller. The clearance is not zero on purpose — the union is a consensus
  of third-party measurements, so a platform a point more aggressive than it
  still has to miss the mark, and 0.110 is the floor rather than a suggestion.
- **It says "Captions by Wordburn", not "Wordburn", and the brand alone was the
  first version.** It failed the only test that matters: a viewer has no idea
  what made the video. A coined word in a corner explains nothing, and this one
  is misread in a specific direction — `Word-` is game-coded on app stores, which
  is the constraint the icon was designed against in the first place, so
  "Wordburn" over somebody's clip can read as a word game they were playing.
  Naming the job fixes that, carries the term a viewer would search, and reads as
  a credit rather than a stamp, which is the tone to want on a video whose maker
  is being invited to keep using the app.
- **It is stacked, and the icon is back.** "Captions by" in SemiBold over
  **Wordburn** in ExtraBold: the shape every platform's own mark uses, and the
  shape a viewer takes in at a glance rather than reading as a sentence. Set as
  one long line the same words were a caption somebody had left in the corner.
  The pills had lost a straight comparison against the single line, on the
  grounds that three bars with one highlighted only decode for somebody who
  already knows the brand. That argument does not survive the stack. It was
  asking the pills to *say* something, and beside a line that already says the
  whole thing they do the other job — they make the credit one object with an
  edge instead of two sentences of loose type, which is the whole of why a
  platform badge looks like a badge.
- **The icon sits above the words, not beside them.** Beside them it was a third
  column and the badge read as a picture with a caption next to it; over them it
  is the top tier of one block on one left edge, which is the same reason the
  words were stacked in the first place. It also stops the mark reaching
  rightward, where TikTok's rail starts at 0.760 and where a credit has nothing
  to gain. Sized at 1.15 of the brand rather than against the height of both
  lines, because the line it sits over is the one it has to agree with: at that
  ratio the widest pill lands about where "Captions by" ends. Bigger and the
  logo is the loudest thing in a credit, which is backwards.
- **Small, and every ratio was measured rather than chosen.** The brand at 0.0155
  of the canvas height is 29.8 px on a 1080 × 1920 frame and the credit at 0.64 of
  that is 19.1 px; the whole badge is 148 px across — 0.137 of the width, ending
  at 0.187 against the safe zone's 0.760 — and its foot lands at 0.166 against
  `upperMiddle`'s 0.280. It is **narrower** than both the row it replaced (0.221)
  and the single line before that (0.247), while the brand itself is half again
  as big as the line's, which is what stacking buys. It spends that on height,
  0.048 against the row's 0.023, and height is the cheap direction here: the band
  is 0.170 deep and nothing else is in it.
  Short-form plays full-screen, so a 1080-wide frame is about 1:1 on the phone
  and both lines are comfortably legible there — which is why the mock-ups were
  compared at 1:1 rather than shrunk to a feed that does not exist. Every number
  in this paragraph was read back off a real exported frame, not off the layout.
  The brand is white, the credit 88%, the muted pills 72% and the accent pill the
  icon's own yellow. The shadow is heavier than a caption's — a 0.2 sigma against
  a caption's 0.12 — because the mark is a third of a caption's size and the hard
  case is a white kitchen wall, where the halo is the only thing separating white
  type from the frame. On the near-white still this was designed over, the
  caption's shadow lost the credit line entirely.
- Welcome's headline is set in Spectral, the caption serif, which every other
  line of chrome is barred from using. It is the one screen with no video on it
  and the promise it makes is a promise about type.
- The Unlocked state is part of `/unlock` rather than a screen of its own. It is
  the same screen after the answer changed, and a route that can only be reached
  by having just paid is a route nobody can get back to.
- Unlock is reached from Home, Export, Saved, Settings, Welcome's Restore and now
  the dictionary's cap dialog, each passing where it came from, because "Back to
  export" is the only sensible button for somebody who was mid-export and the
  wrong one for everybody else.
- Home's empty state has no "Start with a video" line. Everything the spec asks
  of it is already there — the primary button is the empty state — and a third
  instruction under a title and a blurb, on a screen with one action, is a
  sentence nobody reads. Looked at on the phone with the projects hidden before
  deciding.
- **The feedback ask is one card at a good moment, not a popup at a random one.**
  An app with no account, no server and no analytics has no telemetry to read, so
  the only way a defect is ever heard about is if somebody writes in — which is
  the argument for asking, and also the honest reason the card gives. What it is
  not is a dialog on a timer: it sits on Saved, the end of the only path that
  produces a file, where the user has just been handed what they came for and
  there is no work to interrupt. Shown after the
  **second** finished export, once ever, and `markFeedbackAsked` fires on the
  dismiss as well as on the two ways out: a card that comes back until it is
  obeyed is a nag, and the Settings row is permanent for anybody who thinks of
  something a fortnight later.
- **The prompt opens three doors, and an earlier draft opened one.** It reads
  "What's working well? What could be better? Any features you'd love to see?"
  over "Share your ideas, suggestions, or anything you think could make Wordburn
  better. I read every message." The first draft asked only what the user had
  just failed to do, on the reasoning that people are poor at designing features
  and good at remembering friction — which is true, and is the better question
  for a bug report. It is the worse question for a mailbox that is empty. A
  single narrow ask tells somebody holding a compliment or a feature idea that
  they have written to the wrong address, and at this stage a blank mail costs
  more than a badly aimed one. The triage happens on the way in, not at the door.
  Worth revisiting once there is enough post to sort.
- **First person singular, everywhere.** "I read every message", not "we". The
  address is one person's and the whole reason it is not a role address is that
  somebody actually answers; a "we" on top of a personal Gmail is a company voice
  the next screen contradicts.
- **It counts `settings.exportsMade`, not `entitlement.exportsUsed`.** The two
  numbers look interchangeable and are not: `recordExport` deliberately leaves an
  unlocked user's count where it was, because that one is about what is owed, so
  gating the card on it would have asked everybody except the people who paid —
  exactly backwards. `exportsMade` lives in `settings.json`, which is the file for
  what is true of the app rather than of a clip, and it is incremented in
  `runExport` beside the entitlement write rather than on the Saved screen, which
  can come back into focus and would have counted again.
- **One ask per screen, and on that one export the card takes the tier line's
  place.** Stacking a request for help on top of a request for money makes both
  read as the same thing. The unlock nudge is on every other export this person
  will ever make, so it can lose exactly one impression. Answering the card leaves
  the slot empty for the rest of the visit rather than falling back to the tier
  line: an upsell appearing the instant somebody declines to write in would read
  as the price of saying no.
- **The address is personal and that is the point.** `leandrosdennis@gmail.com`
  rather than a role address on the app's own domain, because `hello@` reads as a
  company with a support rota and this is one person who answers. The cost is real
  and accepted: it cannot be handed to anybody else later. The subject is
  prefilled `Wordburn <version> — feedback` **and** the card says to keep the word
  in it, because a mail app is free to drop a `mailto` subject and a report titled
  "Hi" is one that will not be found twice. The body carries the version, the
  Android release and the model off `Platform.constants`, so the first reply is an
  answer rather than a question about which build it was. TikTok is the second
  route and labelled by job — mail for something broken, a DM for a request —
  since a DM carries no version and can be closed by an account setting.
- **`canOpenURL` is not the check.** On Android 11 and up it answers for
  `mailto:` only when the manifest declares a matching `<queries>` intent, so
  guarding with it reports "no mail app" on phones that have one. `openURL` inside
  a `try` is the check, and the fallback alert hands over the address itself: a
  dead button on the one screen asking for help is worse than no button.
- **Invariant 4 is about editing surfaces, and Export is not one.** The editor
  pauses its player when the screen loses focus. Every editing surface is a
  sheet over that screen and a sheet does not take the route's focus, so they
  are unaffected; Export, Saved, the dictionary and Settings are screens of
  their own. The player loops, so before this a clip carried on talking
  underneath them — you could finish an export and still be listening to the
  video over "Saved to gallery", for as long as you left it there. It does not
  start again on the way back: returning to a screen is not asking it to play.
- Reduced motion reaches the chrome as well as the captions: the navigator's fade
  and the sheet's slide both go to `none`. On Android this is the same switch the
  platform uses to suppress them itself, so the app cannot be seen to be doing it
  — it is done because asking for motion the user turned off is wrong whether or
  not anyone can tell. It now also turns off the per-word entrance, on the same
  one rule the emphasis rise already went through.
- **A tile draws Spotlight's big word in the block, where the preset puts it in
  a band of its own.** The two bands are most of a phone screen apart and a tile
  is a hundred points tall, so an honest tile shows one word or the other. A
  tile that answers "what does this look like" with half the answer is worse
  than one that shows the pieces together, and the real arrangement is in the
  preview above the sheet while the tile is being tapped.
- The preset tiles share one Skia canvas, each a translated and clipped group
  landing in the rectangle its own button reported through `onLayout`. The
  buttons are ordinary views and know nothing about time, so twenty redraws a
  second do not walk ten buttons' worth of views with them.
- Newsprint is the one preset that prints dark on light, so the word sitting on
  the highlight stays ink rather than taking the accent, and both the highlight
  and the big word wear a hard ink offset. That offset is not decoration: white
  is one of the six swatches and the card is white.

## Persistence

`entitlement.json` sits beside `settings.json` and holds what has been paid for:
`unlocked` and `unlockedAt` (the legacy lifetime purchase, under the names every
file on a phone already uses), `subscription` (plan, renewing, suspended and when
Play last said so), `exportsUsed`, `firstRunAt`. Separate from settings
because a receipt and a dismissed coach card have nothing to do with each other,
and because deleting it is how a free tier gets reset for testing. Play is the
real record; this file is the app's memory of what Play last said.

`events.jsonl`, beside them, is the event log: `paywall_shown`, `plan_selected`,
`trial_started`, `subscribed`, `batch_started`, `autoclip_run`,
`language_selected`, `export_done`, with counts and never content. It is never
transmitted — there is no analytics SDK and the privacy policy still says
nothing is collected — and it is trimmed to the newest 2000 lines.

A project owns everything it needs: `project.json`, `pipeline.json`, `audio.pcm`,
`envelope.f32`, `thumb.jpg`, `source.<ext>`, the video itself, and `export.mp4`
once there has been one. The export stays because Share needs a file to hand
over and the gallery copy is a `content://` URI the share sheet cannot always
take; the next export of that project overwrites it. `settings.json`
sits outside them all and holds what is true of the app rather than of a clip: the
coach card, and the style the next project starts in.

The video is copied in at pick time and the project never refers to anything
outside its own directory. The picker does not hand back the file in the gallery,
it hands back a copy in this app's cache, and a project pointing at that copy
opens on a black rectangle the moment the system reclaims the space. When the
video is missing anyway, the editor says so and offers to pick it again, because
the transcript is the expensive part and it is still there.

## Export

`src/export/run.ts` is the only caller of the burn-in module, the way
`src/asr` is the only caller of whisper. It builds the plan, starts the
foreground service, renders, publishes to the gallery, and spends a free export
— in that order, so a render that fails or is cancelled costs the user nothing.

The captions cross into native as a **draw list, not as instructions**.
`buildBurnPlan` runs the same `layoutCaptionFrame` the preview runs, with the
same Skia measurer, at the export's own pixel size, and writes positions, sizes,
colours and a baseline per word to a JSON file. Kotlin rasterises that with
`android.graphics`, which is the same Skia underneath, and decides nothing. The
five font files are the app's own: the module's Gradle build points its assets
directory at `assets/fonts`, so there is one copy in the repository and no way
for the two sides to set a word in a face the other never saw.

Entries are emitted only where the draw list changes, so a box highlight holding
still for a whole word is one entry rather than thirty, and the encoder reuses
the overlay texture it already uploaded. A karaoke fill changes every frame and
costs an entry every frame. A revealing preset costs entries while a word is
arriving and none once it has landed, which puts it between the two. The
comparison is over the whole entry, card included: a plate that changed while
the words did not would otherwise be dropped.

**The free tier's mark rides on the plan, not in the entries.** One
`watermark` object at the top of the file, absent entirely for anyone who has
paid. Repeating it in every entry would grow the JSON by a thousand copies of the
same thing and tell `CaptionPainter` nothing it did not know — worse, it would be
compared as part of the shape that dedupes entries, so a constant would be
carried through every comparison for nothing. The painter clears and repaints the
overlay bitmap whenever the entry changes and the encoder reuses it in between,
so drawing the mark last on each of those repaints is what puts it on every
frame. `buildBurnPlan` builds it with the same `layoutWatermark` the preview
called, over the same measurer, against the export's own canvas — the whole of
why it lands in the same place in both.

**The mark's icon crosses as boxes and its words as lines**, which is to say as
things both renderers already draw. A pill is the same `BoxDraw` a box highlight
is, so `Box` in the preview and `drawBox` in the painter take it unchanged, and
a line is the same shadow-then-glyphs pair a word is. Describing a logo in a
vocabulary of its own would have been a third drawing for the two sides to
disagree about, for a picture that is three rounded rectangles.

**A shadow's blur crosses as a sigma.** Skia's blur mask takes a Gaussian sigma
and `android.graphics`'s `BlurMaskFilter` takes a radius, converting it itself
with `radius * 0.57735 + 0.5`. The painter runs that backwards. Handing the
number straight over would have made every shadow in the exported file nearly
twice as soft as the one in the preview — invariant 2 broken in the one place
nobody would think to look, because both sides would have been "using the blur
from the plan".

The pipeline is decoder → external texture → GL → the encoder's input surface:
no frame is ever decoded to the CPU and no pixel is read back. Rotation is baked
into the texture coordinates rather than left to an orientation hint, because a
hint asks the player to rotate and the players that ignore it would show a
sideways video with upright captions. Audio is copied across as compressed
samples: the user's voice was already right and a second lossy pass is damage
for nothing.

Preview and export are the same layout at two pixel sizes, which is not the same
as the same pixels. Measured on the A54: the caption's centre landed within 0.2
export pixels of the preview's, and its box came out 5 pixels narrower in a 576
wide frame — under one percent, and invisible. That difference is in the plan,
not in the burn-in, which can only draw the rectangle it is handed: hinted glyph
advances round differently at a canvas 1024 tall than at one 1077 tall. Laying
the export out at the preview's size instead would trade that for a blurry file.

The video is published with `expo-media-library`'s `Asset` and `Album` into a
Wordburn album, and the file is renamed to what the user is told it is called
before it is published, so the gallery and the share sheet agree. The permission
asked for is write-only and video-only, which on Android 13 and up is no
permission at all: verified on the A54 by revoking every media grant and
exporting anyway.

The function API that the docs still lead with — `createAssetAsync` and friends —
is deprecated in SDK 57 and throws at runtime rather than warning. It was found
by exporting on the phone, which is the only place it could have been found.

The .srt goes through MediaStore in the module, into Downloads. A subtitle file
is not media and no media library will take one. That path needs Android 10,
which is a gap: `minSdkVersion` is 26.

## Rendering

`src/render` is the only consumer of a draw list, and it decides nothing.
`faces.ts` maps a `FaceSpec` onto one of the five bundled files, `typefaces.ts`
loads them into Skia under those exact names so a match is a lookup and not a
guess about embedded weight metadata, `measure.ts` builds the one measurer
(memoised, and a cached measurement equals a cold one), `frame.ts` segments a
project once and hands every frame to the same layout, and `CaptionOverlay.tsx`
draws what it is given. The burn-in will build its own measurer over the same
faces at export resolution, which is how invariant 2 survives the bridge.

The preview canvas is the video's own rectangle inside the stage, not the stage,
because every ratio in the layout is a fraction of the canvas and the export
renders into the frame rather than into the letterbox.

One clock reads the player once per display frame and the overlay, the scrubber
and the transcript subscribe to it. Nothing above them re-renders, which is what
keeps the video view out of the render loop. The style sheet's grid subscribes
to the same clock at a twentieth of a second, because a thumbnail does not need
sixty frames and the preview does.

A style tile is a window, not a thumbnail: the canvas is the whole frame at tile
width and the tile shows the band the caption is in. Laying out into a short
canvas would put a lower third a third of the way up a letterbox and show a size
the export will never produce. All ten windows are cut out of one canvas —
`CaptionElements` is the drawing without a canvas around it, and `CaptionOverlay`
is that plus the canvas and the view it sits in.

Settings carry a style too, written when the style sheet closes and read by
`createProject`. A creator has a look, not a look per clip.

Settings can also set it directly, at `/settings/style`, over `sample.ts`'s
standing line instead of a transcript: the same `StylePicker`, the same
`createFrameSource`, the same one layout. Before that screen the style had one
home and it was the editor's sheet, so Settings could only report it — a row
reading "Box highlight" that answered no tap, which is what a broken row looks
like, and no way at all to change it without a project open. The picker keeps
its Done for the sheet and drops it here, where the screen's own Back is the way
out; `CaptionLayer` and the safe zone moved out of the editor screen so both
previews draw through one of each.

## Caption styles, and what the references taught us

Four competitor clips sit in `references/`, **which is not in git** — they are
somebody else's footage and this repository keeps none. What survives the clone
is this section: what they do, why, and which property each thing became.

Watched frame by frame rather than admired, they turn out to share four
mechanisms and disagree only about arrangement — so those four are properties on `StyleProps` that any preset may
set, and the presets are arrangements of them. A further look should be a new
entry in `STYLE_PRESETS` and no new code, and eight of the eighteen are exactly
that: see **What the research report added**, below.

- **`reveal: 'word'`.** The line builds as it is spoken; a word the viewer has
  not heard is not on screen. All four clips do this and one of them opens by
  showing a static block of subtitles as the thing that makes people scroll. The
  fit is decided against the *whole* line and only then is the visible prefix
  laid out, so the type does not shrink under the reader as the line fills.
- **`entrance`.** Every word arrives — scale, slide, fade — not only the
  emphasised one. `emphasis.riseFrom` stays and owns the big word's scale,
  because how a big word arrives is part of what a preset says about big words.
  The slide is folded into the emitted coordinates rather than carried as a new
  field, so a renderer that can draw a word at a place can draw one arriving.
- **`shadow`.** A soft shadow, or with no offset and `OWN_COLOR`, a glow. Every
  reference holds its type off the frame this way; a hard stroke reads as a
  caption a piece of software added. `blurRatio` is a Gaussian sigma.
- **`plate`.** One card behind the whole block. It is sized against the box
  *every* word could wear rather than the one wearing it, and off where the
  words settle rather than where they are mid-entrance — either mistake makes
  the card the only thing on screen the eye follows.

A fifth arrived with a tenth clip, `kitverify-offer-portrait.mp4`, and it is the
one the app now opens in. **`highlightMode: 'snap'`** is karaoke without the
sweep: the whole line is on screen, a word crosses between the two colours whole
at the instant it is reached, and nothing else on the frame moves. Read frame by
frame at 30 fps, that clip never catches a word half-filled, and the mechanism it
is using is the one most of these apps ship as their own default. It is a mode
rather than a preset flag because the only thing it changes is *when* the colour
arrives, and it cost the export nothing: the burn-in already draws whatever
colour the draw list names.

Two smaller ones came with them: `emphasis.band` puts the big word in a band of
its own, which is the whole shape of the loudest clip (a huge word across the
top, the sentence it came from small in the lower third), and `boxShadow` keeps
a pale highlight a visible shape on a light card.

### Where we are behind them, and where we are ahead

Four of the presets answer a clip each: Headline is the Captions one, Word stack
the invideo one, Spotlight the Veed-shaped one, Newsprint the plate. Two things
in those clips this app still cannot do, both named above: **letter spacing**
and a **condensed display face**.

What none of the four can do is the thing this app already had and was not using
hard enough. **Their emphasis is a setting; ours is acoustic.** invideo's own
settings panel is on screen in one of the clips — "Emphasized text", a font
colour and a background colour, applied to words the user marks. `emphasis.ts`
picks the big word from how it was *said*: loudness over the clip's speech
median, how long it was held, the pause around it. That is a thing a keyword
list cannot do, and **Neon** is the preset built to show it off — the word the
speaker leaned on is the word that lights up, without anybody tagging it.

Neon is also the one arrangement none of the four clips contains: a karaoke fill
under a glow, where the halo turns colour before the fill reaches it. The fill
and the reveal are theirs; the acoustic pick and the leading glow are not.

`OWN_COLOR` is a sentinel and the layout is the only thing that ever sees it: a
glow is a word bleeding its own colour, so it has to follow the swatch, and the
draw list that crosses into the export carries the resolved colour.

The four v1 presets were left exactly as they were. They are accepted, verified
designs and `reveal` is one property away for whoever wants to A/B them; what
this slice owed was better looks on offer, not a redesign of the ones already
signed off.

Two things the references do that this app still cannot: **letter spacing**,
which the small caps row of the Captions-style headline leans on, and a
**condensed display face**, which is most of why that headline reads as a poster.
Tracking would have to go through the measurer to survive invariant 2, and a
condensed face is another font file against the five megabytes of headroom the
APK has left. Both are real gaps and neither is guesswork to close.

### What the research report added

`references/deep-research-report.md` is the second source of looks and the only
one that is not footage. It sits beside the clips and is **not in git** for the
same reason they are not: it is mostly somebody else's catalogue, quoted. What
survives the clone is this subsection.

It reads the category leader's own published catalogue — help
centre, style pages, release notes — and is honest about what it could not find:
there are no per-template usage numbers anywhere, so "most used" is a proxy
built out of a Trending flag and the phrase "popular with", not a measurement.
Eight looks were documented well enough to take apart, and all eight are presets
now.

The important thing it changed is not the eight. It is **which question a
default answers.** The report separates popularity from default suitability and
shows they disagree: the currently trending look is a slow editorial serif aimed
at one niche, and the look it recommends as a baseline is the plainest one in
the catalogue. A default is not a favourite — it is what has to survive footage
nobody has seen. That is why `DEFAULT_STYLE_ID` is Focus and why Focus is the
only preset here carrying a card it did not need for its own sake.

The second thing is that **contrast is a number, not an opinion.** Every colour
pair in those eight was computed rather than eyeballed, and one of them failed:
the blue in the reference shot is 4.30:1 under white, under WCAG's 4.5:1 for
body text. It is 5.32:1 here. The same arithmetic is why Clarity's card is a
warm charcoal at 90% (7.48:1) and why Negative exists at all (21:1 both ways).

What it could not give us is anything to verify against. There are no reference
clips for these — only stills and prose — so the arrangements are this app's
reading of a description, where slice 11's were checked frame by frame against
video. That is the argument for looking at all eight on a phone before any of
them is called done.

One mechanism came out of it: **`highlightMode: 'active'`**, above. Five of the
eight are pure arrangement and needed nothing, one of them (Negative) turned out
to be two properties this file already had pointed at each other — a black plate
and a white box — and two (Clarity, Focus) are the plate doing a job it was
written for and had never been asked to do.

### The harness

`layoutCaptionFrame` is pure and the fonts are on disk, so the design can be
looked at without a build: advance widths out of the TTFs with fontTools, the
real layout over a fake transcript, the draw list written out as SVG on a video
still, screenshotted headless. That is how the plate was caught breathing, how
the preset numbers were chosen, and how the white-swatch-on-a-white-card case
was found. It lives in the scratchpad rather than the repo because it is a
second renderer, and a second renderer that shipped would be something for the
export to drift against.

## Editing

Every change to a project goes through `useProjectEditor`, which is what keeps
undo, the local emphasis recompute and the save policy in one file instead of in
every screen. Four doors, because four things may move: `edit` for text, where no
time may change; `editTiming` for the timing sheet, where the named words' times
may change and nothing else may; `editProject` for shift-all, which moves the
offset and may not touch a word at all; and `restyle`, which is not an undo step
at all. Each of the first three checks its own rule on the real transcript before
it writes.

`restyle` applies the change to every snapshot in the history as well as to the
present. A style is a property of the project rather than something that happened
to it, so undoing a word edit must not hand back the preset the user had already
abandoned. The style the user settles on is also written to `settings.json` when
the sheet closes, and a new project starts there. Undo is snapshots, not inverse operations: an edit already
returns a whole new project sharing the words it did not touch, so keeping the
old value costs pointers, while inverting a merge or a split is a chance to
restore something subtly different. Depth is capped at 100.

Writes are debounced by 500 ms and flushed when the app leaves the foreground or
the screen unmounts. **`restyle` is debounced too, and it used to be immediate**
— "a style change is one deliberate tap, not a stream of keystrokes", which
stopped being true the first time the sheet grew a control you drag. The hue
strip was writing the whole project file on every frame of a drag and the
position dial would have doubled it. Nothing is at risk in the change: the
debounce is flushed at the two moments invariant 3 is actually about.

`timingDrift` runs on every text edit, on the phone, against the real
transcript: with the word count unchanged nothing may move at all, which is
invariant 1 exactly, and when a split, merge or delete has changed the count what
is checked instead is that no time was invented outside the span that was there.
A failure says so and refuses to write. `timingSpill` is its mirror on the timing
path, where time is allowed to move: the same words in the same order, no text
touched, nothing moved that was not named, and no overlap the action itself
introduced. Unit tests prove the same rules against fixtures; these are the
copies that run on the user's own words.

The editor's sheets share one `Sheet`, and its contents change rather than the
modal being swapped: unmounting one Android `Modal` in the same commit that
mounts another shows neither. A sheet's draft is a whole preview `Project` held
by the editor screen, so the overlay, the transcript and the loop all see what is
about to be applied without any of them learning what a draft is, and one visit
to a sheet is one undo step however many times a handle moved.

## The dictionary

`dictionary.json` sits beside `settings.json`, outside any project: a creator's
brand name is spelled the same way in every video they will ever make.

It reaches a transcript twice. Before the words exist, the spellings go to
whisper as an initial prompt, which biases the decoder toward writing them in the
first place — and a spelling the engine chose itself keeps the timing it heard,
where a repair afterwards merges words. After the words exist, `applyDictionary`
replaces what was heard with what the user spells. The prompt is read once at the
start of a run: a pass that picked up a new word halfway through would have
transcribed the first half without it.

**Prompt bias is measured and off.** Same clip, same build, same emulator, each
run repeated:

| prompt | words from a 0:53 clip |
|---|---|
| none | 173, complete |
| `Media, Zephyrine` | 80, better than half the clip gone |
| `This video mentions Media, Zephyrine.` | 166, one clause dropped |

The shape mattered more than the content: whisper takes the prompt as the
transcript that came *before* this audio, so a bare run of proper nouns reads as
a fragment of speech and the decoder carries on in that shape. A sentence nearly
fixed it. Nearly is not enough to lose a phrase of somebody's actual speech, so
`PROMPT_BIAS` in `src/asr/runner.ts` is false. The mechanism and the sentence
shape stay for a proper study across clips.

A decoy word in the prompt — `Zephyrine`, said nowhere in the clip — was not
hallucinated into either prompted transcript.

A word sheet hands the dictionary a half-written entry: the corrected text is the
spelling and what the engine heard is the first variant, so there is nothing to
type. The editor's chip counts what the dictionary would still change in this
transcript and applies it as one undo step, which is also how a project made
before an entry existed catches up.

## What the style sheet costs, and why it still costs it

**Measured again in slice 11, and the answer is better than the table below.**
The last paragraph of this section describes one canvas for the whole grid as
the fix that would attack the real twenty points, and declines to build it for
an unmeasured payoff. Adding presets forced the question — nine canvases at the
old rate would have doubled the worst row — so it was built, and on the A54,
release build, six seconds of playback each:

| editor playing, 120 Hz panel | frames | janky | 50th | 90th | 99th |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| style sheet closed, four tiles, four canvases (slice 10) | — | 4% | — | 8 ms | 13 ms |
| style sheet **open**, four tiles, four canvases (slice 10) | — | 37% | 9 ms | 20 ms | 36 ms |
| style sheet closed, Spotlight, shadows on every word | 570 | **4.9%** | 6 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms |
| style sheet **open**, eight tiles, one canvas | 505 | **23.6%** | 11 ms | 18 ms | 26 ms |

Two things fall out of that. **A shadow costs the overlay nothing measurable** —
Spotlight draws every word twice, once through a blur mask, and closed-sheet
playback is the same 4-to-5% it was with a stroke. And **one canvas more than
paid for four extra tiles**: twice the presets at two thirds of the jank, with
the 99th percentile down from 36 ms to 26 ms. The remaining twenty-odd points
are the modal window and the shrunken stage, which the slice 10 table already
attributed nine of before a tile drew anything.

The table below stands as the history that justified the change.

Taken apart on the A54 with `dumpsys gfxinfo`, six seconds of playback per
reading, release builds, one control build per row:

| editor playing, 120 Hz panel | janky | 90th | 99th |
|---|---|---|---|
| style sheet closed | 4% | 8 ms | 13 ms |
| open, tiles drawing nothing | 13% | 16 ms | 25 ms |
| open, four canvases frozen | 17% | 17 ms | 28 ms |
| open, four canvases at 10 a second | 32% | 17 ms | 30 ms |
| open, four canvases at 20 a second — what ships | 37% | 20 ms | 36 ms |

Nine of the thirty-three points are the modal window and the shrunken stage,
before a tile draws anything. Four more are four Skia canvases merely existing.
The remaining twenty are the per-update work: a layout and a picture recording
per tile. The GPU is not involved at any point — it sits at 2 ms median, 7 ms at
the 99th, while `Slow UI thread` and `Slow issue draw commands` carry the count.

Two fixes were built and measured and neither shipped. **Staggering** the four
tiles onto different frames, on the theory that they were spiking together, made
it slightly worse: this is load, not a spike. **Halving the rate to ten a second**
moved 37% to 32% — but the same 20 Hz build measured 36.7% and 42.2% on two
different runs, so the ±5 point noise band is the whole size of the gain, and it
buys that by making a karaoke fill step visibly in the tile that exists to show
a karaoke fill travelling.

What is left is the one thing that would attack the real twenty points without
touching what the user sees: **one Skia canvas for the whole grid** instead of
four, with the cells as translated groups, so four picture recordings become one.
That is a rework of an accepted screen for an unmeasured payoff, so it is written
down rather than done.

The screen is not broken at 37%. Ninety percent of frames land inside 20 ms with
the sheet open, which is inside a 60 Hz budget; this is a 120 Hz panel and the
app is holding about 105 frames a second while animating five captions at once.

## The store

`src/policy/store.ts` is the only caller of expo-iap, the way `src/asr` is the
only caller of whisper. **Since slice 15 the product is a subscription**,
`wordburn_pro`, with three base plans — `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` — and a
free-trial offer on `yearly` that lives in Play Console, not in code. The old
non-consumable, `captions_unlock_v1`, is never sold again and is still queried on
every launch: whoever owns it has Pro for life, every later feature included.
Nobody ever bought it, so today that branch protects nobody, and deleting it
would be the one change that could ever take a paid product away.

Who is Pro is `src/policy/pro.ts`, pure and tested, and the states are the ones a
client can actually see without a server:

| Play returns | `proStatus` | Pro? |
|---|---|---|
| the legacy purchase | `lifetime` | yes, forever |
| a live subscription (grace period included) | `subscribed`, `renewing: true` | yes |
| a live subscription the user cancelled | `subscribed`, `renewing: false` | yes, until it lapses |
| a suspended purchase (account hold, paused) | `suspended` | no — the line says fix it in Play |
| nothing | `free` | no |
| no answer at all | whatever it said last | yes for 14 days, then no |

The last row is the one to understand. A lifetime unlock is never taken away,
for the reason it never was: a tunnel, a Play Services update and a refund look
identical from here. A subscription *is* taken away, because ending is its normal
life — but not because Play was unreachable. `syncEntitlement` writes nothing
when there is no answer, and `OFFLINE_GRACE_DAYS` counts from the last one.
Suspended purchases are asked for (`includeSuspendedAndroid`) precisely so that
somebody on account hold is told to fix a payment rather than sold a
subscription they already have.

No price is composed in this app. Every amount on the paywall is Play's own
string, and the one number worked out here — yearly's per-month figure — is
Play's micros over twelve, formatted by `Intl` in Play's currency **with as many
decimals as Play used**, because ISO gives the rupiah two and Play writes none.
`plans.test.ts` has the case that caught it.

A purchase does not come back from `requestPurchase`. It arrives on
`purchaseUpdatedListener`, so both listeners are attached before the sheet opens
and removed when it settles. Anything owned and live is acknowledged with
`finishTransaction({ isConsumable: false })` — Play refunds an unacknowledged
purchase after three days and there is no server here to do it later — and an
already-acknowledged purchase is left alone. Managing, cancelling and fixing a
payment all happen on Play's own page, through `deepLinkToSubscriptions`.

There is no receipt validation, because it would need a server this app does not
have.

This and the language-model download are the only network calls in the app.
Nothing here is ever awaited on a path that leads to a caption: the launch check
is fire and forget in the root layout, and everywhere else the user asked for it
and is watching a spinner.

A debug build shows sample plans at the placeholder prices when Play has nothing
to sell it, which is always, so the paywall can be looked at. A release build
never does.

## Emphasis

Emphasis is data, picked in `emphasis.ts` from how the word was said: loudness
over the clip's speech median, how long it was held, the pause around it, plus
numbers, dictionary spellings and names. Every weight sits in one `EMPHASIS`
object. Stopwords and unverified low-confidence words are barred outright.
`autoEmphasis` is frozen at `ready` and re-picked only in the edited display unit
and one either side. Each preset decides how an emphasised word looks.

The word sheet carries the toggle and says which way the word was decided.
Emphasised words are bold in the transcript, and the style sheet's Editorial tile
animates the user's own line with its real picks.

## Things Android taught us the hard way

- `ServiceCompat.startForeground` masks the requested type against the ones its
  androidx version knows, and hands the framework a zero for `mediaProcessing`.
  The platform then refuses to start a typed service with no type and the app
  dies on the main thread. Call `Service.startForeground` directly.
- Never await a foreground-service call from the pipeline. One that did not
  settle stopped a run between two chunks with every chunk already on disk.
  The notification is a courtesy; the transcription is the product.
- Android 15 gives a typed service a time budget and calls `onTimeout`. Ignore
  it and the app is killed.
- `expo-video` loads a source handed to `useVideoPlayer` before an effect on the
  same render gets to subscribe, and `sourceLoad` does not replay for a listener
  that arrives late. Read `player.videoTrack` and `player.duration` directly as
  well as listening, or the screen never learns the shape of the video.
- **A pushed screen does not stop the one underneath it.** `expo-video` pauses a
  player when the app is backgrounded, which is why nothing looked wrong for ten
  slices, but navigating within the app is not backgrounding: the editor stayed
  mounted under Export and its looping player kept playing. Pause on blur, and
  guard it — the cleanup also runs on unmount, where `useVideoPlayer` has
  already released the player and a `pause()` on a released shared object
  throws. `adb shell dumpsys audio` is how to see this without ears: the app's
  `AudioPlaybackConfiguration` reads `state:started` when it should not.
- A release build is not debuggable, so `adb shell run-as` cannot reach the app's
  own files. Seeding a fixture project into app storage needs the debug build.
- `expo-image-picker` returns a copy it made in `cache/ImagePicker`, not the file
  in the gallery. That copy does not last. A project that keeps the URI plays
  until the cache is cleared and then opens black with a play button that does
  nothing, which is how this was found. `adb shell pm trim-caches 4096G`
  reproduces it on demand.
- `expo-media-library`'s function API is deprecated in SDK 57 and throws when
  called, rather than warning. The class-based `Asset.create` and `Album` are
  what work. Nothing in a typecheck says so.
- Unmounting one `Modal` in the same commit that mounts another leaves Android
  showing neither, with no error anywhere. One sheet whose contents change.
- A `PanResponder` built in a `useMemo` keeps the callbacks of the render that
  built it. The hue strip applied its colour to whichever preset had been
  selected when the sheet opened, silently undoing the one chosen since. Every
  value a responder reads goes through a ref.
- `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject` is not in this React Native's types. Spell the
  four edges out.
- `adb shell input swipe` at the wrong y proves nothing, and a screenshot of the
  result looks exactly like a component that will not scroll. Slice 10 "found"
  a broken toolbar ScrollView that way, wrote a `flex: 1` fix with a confident
  comment, and then a control build without the fix scrolled identically. The
  swipe had been missing the row by twenty-five pixels. Before believing a device
  test that says something is broken, make the same gesture prove it can succeed.
- Play Billing 8 stopped omitting a SKU it cannot find. `fetchProducts` returns a
  `Product` for it with the fields blank and `productStatusAndroid` saying why, so
  a `?? null` on `displayPrice` hands an empty string straight through. On the A54
  the button read "Unlock for " with nothing after it, because the app is not
  published. Check the price is a non-empty string, not that a product came back.
- Raising `minSdkVersion` past 28 makes AGP store DEX uncompressed. Nothing warns,
  and this app's 51 MB of DEX turned a 145 MB APK into a 179 MB one. It is a
  packaging change, not a payload change: the same contents deflate to 112 MB,
  which is nearer what a store delivers. The 51 MB was the other half of the
  lesson and it took Play's own warning to see it: none of that DEX had ever
  been through R8. See the next note. It is 11.9 MB now and the APK is 139 MB,
  so the packaging change that looked like 34 MB of damage was sitting on top of
  39 MB of code nobody was using.
- **The generated project ships release DEX with no R8 at all, and Play grades
  you on it.** AGP's template reads `android.enableMinifyInReleaseBuilds` and
  `expo-build-properties` can write it, but nothing in Expo turns it on, so every
  bundle this repo produced went to Play unshrunk, unoptimized and
  unobfuscated. Play Console says so on the bundle — "DEX code optimization is
  below our threshold", **Obfuscation 1%**, everything else a dash, and a
  deadline attached — and the fix is the one
  https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/code-optimization
  gives. It is two changes and only one of them is the flag.
  `enableMinifyInReleaseBuilds` and `enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds` go in
  `app.json`. The other is `plugins/with-r8-optimization.js`, because
  `proguardFiles` is not a build property Expo exposes and AGP's template picks
  `proguard-android.txt`, whose only line of substance is `-dontoptimize` —
  which is exactly the dash under "Optimization percentage". It has to be a
  plugin for the same reason the signing config does: `android/` is regenerated
  and a hand edit lives until the next `prebuild`.
  **The keep rules are the part that can break the app, and this one has one.**
  whisper.rn binds through `Java_com_rnwhisper_RNWhisperModule_installJSIBindings`,
  a JNI symbol built out of the class's own name, so `com.rnwhisper` is kept
  whole — a package-wide keep of the kind the Play guidance warns about, over
  four classes. Everything else is already covered by consumer rules the
  libraries ship: React Native keeps `@DoNotStrip` and every `native <methods>`,
  expo-modules-core keeps `Module` subclasses by name while explicitly allowing
  them to be obfuscated and optimized, and reanimated and worklets keep
  themselves. Nothing in this app's own Kotlin needed a rule: the burn-in reads
  its plan with `org.json` and the foreground service is a manifest component,
  which AGP keeps for you.
  **R8 reports what it did, and it counts the share it did *not* do.**
  `android/app/build/intermediates/r8_metadata/release/minifyReleaseWithR8/r8-metadata.dat`
  is the same JSON that rides in the bundle as `BUNDLE-METADATA/com.android.tools/r8.json`
  and is what Play reads. On this app: `noObfuscationPercentage` 15.99,
  `noOptimizationPercentage` 16.46, `noShrinkingPercentage` 15.92 — so 84%
  obfuscated against Play's floor of 25%. Before the change that file was
  `d8.json` with no stats in it at all, which is what a dash in the console
  means.
  **Obfuscation is also why `mapping.txt` now matters.** It is 121 MB in
  `android/app/build/outputs/mapping/release/`, AGP puts it in the bundle by
  itself, and without it a crash in Play Console is unreadable.
- React Native's Android alert calls `options.onDismiss` when a button closes the
  dialog, not only when the dialog is dismissed, so a promise wrapped around an
  alert cannot tell the two apart and latches onto whichever fires first. Put the
  work in the button's own callback and do not await an alert.
- **A release build is signed with the debug keystore until you stop it, and you
  cannot stop it by editing `build.gradle`.** AGP's template points the release
  build type at `signingConfigs.debug`, which is the same key on every React
  Native machine there has ever been, and Play refuses it. `android/` is not in
  git and every `prebuild` writes it again, so a hand edit lives until the next
  one. It has to be a config plugin: `plugins/with-release-signing.js`. Its
  anchors are AGP template text, and the template spells the assignment both
  `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug` and `signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug`
  depending on version — the plugin throws when an anchor stops matching, rather
  than quietly leaving the debug key in place.
- **A blur is a sigma on one side of the bridge and a radius on the other.**
  Skia's blur mask filter takes a Gaussian sigma; `BlurMaskFilter` takes a
  radius and converts it with `radius * 0.57735 + 0.5`. Nothing in either API
  says which it wants, and passing the plan's number to both would have made
  every exported shadow nearly twice as soft as the previewed one, with both
  sides able to claim they used the number they were given. `CaptionPainter`
  converts.
- **Nothing resizes under a `Modal` when the keyboard opens.** The manifest asks
  for `adjustResize` and React Native asks the dialog it puts a `Modal` in for it
  as well, and on the A54 neither window gave up a pixel: the IME came up over
  the whole entry sheet, title and buttons and all, not merely over the field
  being typed into. Every text field in this app is inside a sheet, so this was
  every text field in the app. `KeyboardAvoidingView` does not rescue it — with
  no `behavior` it renders a plain `View` and does nothing, and `padding`
  subtracts the keyboard from a frame that is the dialog's rather than the
  screen's. What does work is reading the height off `keyboardDidShow`, which
  React Native takes from the IME's own window insets and reports whether or not
  anything resized, and padding the dock by it. That is `useKeyboardInset`, and
  `Sheet` is its only caller.
- **`android/` holds a copy of the version, and a copy goes stale.** `expo
  prebuild` writes `versionName` and `versionCode` into `android/app/build.gradle`
  once; bumping `app.json` afterwards changes nothing, because `android/` is only
  regenerated when it is missing. A bundle sat on this disk carrying 0.0.1 while
  `app.json` said 1.0.0 — and `build-aab.sh` printed "version 1.0.0" on the way
  out, because it read the version it had asked for rather than the one it got.
  Nothing anywhere warns. `scripts/version.sh` syncs `build.gradle` from
  `app.json` before every Gradle run and then reads the version back out of the
  finished artifact: `aapt2 dump badging` for an APK, and for a bundle
  `scripts/aab-version.py`, because aapt2 cannot open an `.aab` at all and
  bundletool is not installed here. Saying the version back to yourself is not a
  check.
- **`head -1` under `pipefail` kills what feeds it, and `set -e` then kills the
  script — with no message.** The version check above went on to break the build
  it was checking. `version_of_apk` piped `aapt2 dump badging` into `head -1`;
  head leaves the moment it has its line, closing the pipe and killing aapt2 with
  SIGPIPE, and `run.sh` runs `set -o pipefail`, which calls that a failed pipeline
  — *after* the version had been read correctly. `set -e` then killed the script
  at the bare assignment `got="$(version_of_apk ...)"`, one line above the branch
  written to warn and carry on, which turned out to have been unreachable its
  whole life. So `./run.sh` exited 1 with **no output whatsoever** after Gradle's
  last line, and looked exactly like a failed build. Gradle had in fact succeeded
  and the APK was sitting on disk. It is a race between how fast aapt2 writes and
  how fast head leaves, so it came and went, and struck more often as the APK
  grew — it arrived for good at 179 MB. Two fixes and both are needed: read the
  whole output and cut the first line in the shell (`_first_line`, which replaced
  every `head -1` in that file), and `|| got=""` on the assignment so a reader
  that fails cannot take the script down with it. `bash -x` is what found it;
  nothing else said a word. None of this is Android-specific — any
  `set -euo pipefail` script piping a chatty command into `head` has it.

## Conventions

- `src/domain` has no platform imports and is unit tested first.
- Native modules expose one function and return a typed record.
- Every ASR call goes through one wrapper. Never call whisper.rn from a screen.
- Conventional commits. One vertical slice per pull request.
