 * The editor.

 * preview is what the export will burn in (invariant 2). Under it, the
 * transcript follows the playhead, and a tap on any word loops that word and
 * opens the sheet that can change it.
 *
 * This file is two screens. `Editor` finds the project and deals with a video
 * that is not there; `Workspace` is the editing surface, and it only exists once
 * there is something to play. Nothing above the pieces that subscribe to the
 * clock re-renders while the video plays, which is what keeps the video view out
