 * How a word arrives: where it is, how big and how solid, at this instant.

 * exporter does not run is exactly how an app ends up with a preview that does
 * not match the file (invariant 2).
 *
 * Scale has two owners and they do not mix. An emphasised word uses the
 * preset's own `riseFrom` over `riseMs`, because how a big word arrives is part
 * of what a preset says about big words; everything else uses the line's
 * `entrance`. Slide and fade come from `entrance` for every word including the
