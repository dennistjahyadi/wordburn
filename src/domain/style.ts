 * four times the first. Those are all properties any preset can take, so what is
 * below is eighteen arrangements of one vocabulary and not eighteen special
 * cases.
 *
 * The last eight came from `references/deep-research-report.md`, which took the category
 * leader's published style catalogue apart the same way — not by copying the
 * pictures, which are somebody else's, but by naming the behaviour each look
 * relies on and asking which property of this file already says it. Seven of the
 * eight needed nothing new. The eighth wanted a mark that moves with the voice
 * and leaves nothing behind it, and that became `highlightMode: 'active'`,
 * which is the test this file sets itself: a look it cannot reach should become
 * a property rather than a branch.
 *
 * Two things in those looks this app still cannot set, both already written down
 * as gaps: letter spacing, which would have to go through the measurer to
 * survive invariant 2, and a condensed display face, which is another font file
 * against what is left of the APK's headroom. Rocket in particular is a
 * condensed poster face in the original and an extra-bold grotesk here.
 *
 * Line height is the third. It is one ratio for the whole app, and the research
 * asks for a tighter one on several of these; a global changed for one preset is
 * a global changed for ten, so it stays where it is until it is a property.
 *
 * The picker was budgeted for eight tiles without a redesign, and the grid
 * moving into one canvas took the ceiling off. Eighteen is past what that
 * redesign anticipated in *scrolling* rather than in drawing — see the note in
