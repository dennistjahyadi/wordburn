/**
 * The style sheet.
 *
 * Eighteen presets and the properties every one of them exposes, because a
 * preset is a set of defaults and never a lock. What the user picks is stored as
 * choices rather than as a pile of properties, so a colour follows them from
 * preset to preset while Clean subtitle still looks like Clean subtitle.
 *
 * The tiles are not thumbnails. Each one lays out the line that is on screen
 * right now, through the same `layoutCaptionFrame` the preview and the export
 * use, at the video's own proportions and cropped to the caption. Eighteen
 * little drawings of what the button does, rather than eighteen pictures of what
 * it did for somebody else.
 *
 * They share one canvas. Eighteen of them would cost eighteen picture recordings
 * a tick, and the per-update work was already the expensive two thirds of this
 * screen at four; as translated groups in a single canvas it is one recording
 * however many presets the list grows to.
 *
 * **Two columns is past its limit at eighteen and has not been looked at on a
 * phone.** Nine rows of tiles is around three screens of scrolling before the
 * colour control, where at ten it was under two, and `SCROLL_SHARE`'s claim
 * below that the grid and the colour are both in view from the start is now
 * false. Three columns, a horizontal band, or a grid that collapses to the
 * chosen row until it is tapped are all plausible and all of them are a
 * redesign of an accepted screen decided by how a tile reads at a third of the
 * width, which is a question for a device and not for this file.
 *
 * Two of the controls under the grid changed shape when the presets did. The
 * colour is a pair — what a marked word is drawn in, and what the rest of the
 * line is — because a caption whose whole design is two colours cannot be
 * described by one. And position is a fraction of the frame with a picture of
 * the frame to set it in, because three chips could only ever offer three
 * answers to a question that is different on every clip.
