 * about 145 MB, and it buys an app that has never once needed the network. The
 * first-launch download was the largest thing that could go wrong in the product
 * and the only screen that existed to watch something fail.
 *
 * whisper.rn opens a bundled model through Android's AssetManager and streams it
 * into the same buffer a file path would have filled, so nothing is unpacked to
 * disk and there is no second copy of 82 MB on the user's phone.
