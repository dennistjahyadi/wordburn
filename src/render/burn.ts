/**
 * The draw list for a whole video, in the shape the burn-in module reads.
 *
 * This is the bridge invariant 2 crosses. The captions in the exported file are
 * laid out here, in JavaScript, by the same `layoutCaptionFrame` and the same
 * Skia measurer the preview uses — only at the export's own pixel size. The
 * native side receives positions, sizes, colours and a baseline per word and
 * decides nothing at all; it rasterises with `android.graphics`, which is the
 * same Skia underneath, and muxes the result.
 *
 * A word names a face by key; the burn-in module carries those same five font
 * files in its own assets, taken by the build from the app's `assets/fonts`
 * directory, so there is one copy of each face in the repository and no way for
 * the two sides to disagree about what a word is set in.
 *
 * Entries are emitted only where the draw list changes. A box-highlight caption
 * holds still for a whole word, so a thirty second clip that would be nine
 * hundred identical frames becomes a few dozen entries, and the encoder can
 * reuse the overlay it already uploaded. Karaoke fills change every frame and
 * get an entry every frame, which is the honest cost of that preset.
