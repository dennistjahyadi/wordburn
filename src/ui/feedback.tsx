 * and not on a timer: Saved is the end of the only path that produces a file, so
 * it is the one screen where the user has just been given what they came for and
 * there is no work to interrupt. A modal over the editor would be the same
 * question asked at the moment it is least welcome.
 *
 * Both routes leave the app, because an app with no server of its own has nowhere to
 * put a form. That is a high-friction ask, which is the second reason to make it
 * once and make it late.
