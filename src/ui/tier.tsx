/**
 * What the free tier costs, said the same way everywhere it is said.
 *
 * Invariant 5 is a promise about consistency as much as about timing: the count
 * on Home before the picker, on Export before the render and on Saved after it
 * have to be one sentence from one place, or the app has three opinions about
 * what the user owns. One component, three screens.
 *
 * The whole row is the tap target. The spec has a chip and a link side by side
 * and both go to the same screen, so making the gap between them dead would be a
 * miss the user cannot see the reason for.
