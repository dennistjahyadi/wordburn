 * paywall after the work is done is the loudest complaint in this whole market.
 *

 * exports until it was not, and the argument that moved it is that **three was a
 * wall in front of the wrong thing**. Checking that the captions match the audio
 * never needed an export: the editor plays the real overlay through the real
 * layout, free and unlimited, which is invariant 2 doing its second job. What the
 * counter actually rationed was finished files — and it charged again for every
 * re-export after a style tweak, so three went in an afternoon.
 *
 * A mark trades that wall for a visible one. Nobody is stopped, the thing being
 * evaluated is still the real thing, and the unlock buys back the frame.
 * `layoutWatermark` holds where it goes and why it is small.
